# Replication files for: Revisiting Conduct Parameter Estimation in Homogeneous Goods Markets: At Least, Linear Model is Valid. 

This replication package contains the data and the code to generate the results reported in "Matsumura, Y., & Otani, S. (2023). Revisiting Conduct Parameter Estimation in Homogeneous Goods Markets: At Least, Linear Model is Valid. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.06665."

For replicating results, you need to run R and julia scripts from 01simulate_data.R to 06XXXX.R in code/ and save the results in output/ and figures and tables in figuretable/. 

Each HTML file corresponds with .rmd script with the same index.

Note that we did not push output/ folder here because the folder contains large files.
