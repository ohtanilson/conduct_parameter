abstract = {Abstract Strategic interaction among firms may hinder the reduction of excess capacity in a declining industry. Policy interventions that attempt to reduce excess capacity may increase efficiency by accelerating the capital adjustment but may decrease efficiency by increasing the market power of firms and/or by distorting firms' divestment decisions. We study capacity coordination policies—forcing firms to reduce their capacity simultaneously—applied to the Japanese cement industry. Estimation results suggest that these interventions did not increase market power because reduction in capacity resulted in higher utilization of the remaining plants, and did not distort firms' scrappage decisions.},

We then relate this competitiveness measure to indicators of countries' banking system structures and regulatory regimes. We find systems with greater foreign bank entry and fewer entry and activity restrictions to be more competitive. We find no evidence that our competitiveness measure negatively relates to banking system concentration. Our findings confirm that contestability determines effective competition especially by allowing (foreign) bank entry and reducing activity restrictions on banks.}

The model is estimated using aggregate data from the Italian regions for the years 1997–2009. Our results show that multimarket contact is positively and significantly correlated to the market power index, and is also connected to both home and non-home market concentration. The evidence is robust to changes in model specification and multimarket contact measures, and supports the idea that firms which have a greater amount of contact are more likely to collude.},

Our evidence indicates that EU banks enjoy a significant degree of market power, which shows a decreasing trend over time and some difference across countries. More competition is associated with higher bank density, lower bank capitalization, more efficient and stable banking systems, better macroeconomic conditions, and the establishment of the SSM. Finally, a clear convergence pattern emerges in the behaviour of EU banks.},

We then briefly talk about commonly used fundamental market structures and illustrate how different combinations of various standard concepts are combined to describe market structures. As dynamic en and markets with product differentiation play important roles in defining market structures, we provide additional information about models with dynamic environments and models with product differentiation in separate sections. We finalize our review by discussing in depth the literature on market structure on innovation, productivity slowdowns and related problems of income inequality.},

  abstract = {Transition was characterized by massive structural changes in most economic sectors in Ukraine. This is especially true for the dairy sector. Several countervailing developments took place under transition that affected the dairy industry. Interregional trade became feasible, the importance of milk delivered by households increased significantly, and most dairies became investor-owned companies. The latter point and the fact that the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine detected several price cartels in the industry lead us to offer that after transition, dairies were able to exercise oligopsony power toward dairy producers at the regional level. This paper estimates market structure models for raw milk in Ukraine using a translog production function for the processing sector at the national and regional level. The results suggest the existence of oligopsony power in three of 25 administrative regions in Ukraine, coupled with a potential deviation of procurement prices for raw milk from the value marginal product of raw milk ranging from 24.6\% to 49.4\%.},

Several of the most convenient measures, unfortunately, are beset by very serious problems, while none are completely ideal. Faced with an ongoing and undiminished need to assess competition and market power nonetheless, we would advocate a focus on the scant handful of “least objectionable” measures. Among these, the Lerner index and the Rothschild–Bresnahan conduct index together provide complementary, well-established, easily understood measures that relate to policy-relevant aspects of market power according to formal underlying theoretical models of firms and industries. The latter approach is slightly more demanding with regard to data and estimation techniques, requiring nonlinear systems estimation except in a correlation version under additional assumptions; one tradeoff is that the correlation version yields only qualitative (rather than quantitative) conclusions about market power.},
