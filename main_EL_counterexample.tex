\section{Introduction}
Measuring competitiveness is an important task in the empirical industrial organization literature.
The conduct parameter approach is one of the useful approaches to measure competitiveness.
However, the parameter cannot be directly measured from data because data generally lack information about marginal costs.
Therefore, researchers endeavor to identify and estimate conduct parameters.

As for the identification of conduct parameters in homogeneous goods markets, there are two influential papers.\footnote{In Google Scholar, the citation count of \citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} is 1765 and that of \citet{lau1982identifying} is 939 on April 28, 2025.}
First, \citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} considers the identification of conduct parameter and marginal cost function in linear demand and linear marginal cost model.
\citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} finds that when the inverse demand function includes a demand shifter, called demand rotation instrument, which changes the slope and intercept of the inverse demand function, the conduct parameter and the parameters of the marginal cost function can be identified.
Recently, \citet{matsumura2023resolving} provide a detailed condition for the identification.
Second, \citet{lau1982identifying} considers a more general setting and investigates the conditions under which the conduct parameter is not identified.
\citet{lau1982identifying} shows that the conduct parameter is not identified if and only if the demand function is separable, except a specific functional form.
As introducing demand rotation instrument makes a inverse demand function non-separable, this result implies that the insight of \citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} is crucial for the identification of conduct parameter in homogeneous goods markets even in a general setting.


The contributions of this paper are as follows. 
First, we point out that the proof of \citet{lau1982identifying} has some problems.
The key argument in his proof is that non-identification implies that there is a transformation between the equilibrium condition under two different models.
In other words, given an equilibrium quantity under a conduct parameter and a marginal cost function, we can construct a transformation that transforms the equilibrium condition under the given conduct parameter and marginal cost function into the equilibrium condition under another conduct parameter and another marginal cost function that satisfies the equilibrium quantity in both models.
This implies that we have two distinct pairs of a conduct parameter and a marginal cost that lead to observable equivalent equilibrium.
However, the way of finding such transformation is incorrect.

Next, to avoid the problem, we provide a novel characterization of non-identification to construct a transformation that connects the equilibrium condition under two different models.
To make the transformation work, we can restrict the functional form of the inverse demand function.
Surprisingly, the resulting class of inverse demand functions implied by non-identification is the set of inverse demand functions that are separable but more restrictive functional form.
Additionally, we find that the class of inverse demand functions also works as a sufficient condition for non-identification.
Therefore, the class of inverse demand functions that lead to identification is much broader than \citet{lau1982identifying} considers.





\section{Setting}\label{sec:setting}
Consider a homogeneous product market with the aggregate inverse demand and aggregate marginal cost function as $P(Q, X^{d})$ and $MC(Q, X^{s})$ where $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ are the vector of exogenous variables.
Let $K_d$ and $K_s$ be the dimension of $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, respectively.
We call $X^{d}$ demand shifters and $X^{s}$ cost shifters, and assume the following:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:exclusive_shifters}
    The demand shifter $X^{d}$ and the cost shifter $X^{s}$ are exclusive; that is, there is no common variable in $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, and $X^{d}$ affects the demand function but not the marginal cost function, and $X^{s}$ affects the marginal cost function but not the demand function; for all $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ and $j = 1, \ldots, K_s$,
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d}) \ne 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_{j}}(Q, X^{s}) \ne 0,\\
        \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{s}_{j}}(Q, X^{d}) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{s}) = 0.
    \end{align}
\end{assumption}
We can also include some common variables in $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, but in that case, we still have some variable that exclusively affects the demand function and the marginal cost function.
\citet{lau1982identifying} also imposes the following restriction on the inverse demand and the marginal cost function:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:twice_differentiable}
    The inverse demand and the marginal cost function are twice continuously differentiable.
\end{assumption}

The equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ is defined as the solution to the following equation:
\begin{align}
    P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) - MC(Q^e, X^{s}) = 0, \label{eq:foc}
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is called the conduct parameter.
Depending on the value of $\theta$, the relation can nest the equilibrium condition of several models, such as perfect competition ($\theta=0$) and Cournot competition ($\theta=1/N$).

\citet{lau1982identifying} does not impose any further restrictions, but we are interested in the point identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function, and hence it is natural to assume that the equilibrium quantity exists and is unique, which needs the following additional assumption:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:unique_equilibrium}
    Given an inverse demand function, a conduct parameter, and a marginal cost function, and given $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, the derivative of the equilibrium condition with respect to $Q$ is not zero and finite, that is,
    \begin{align}
        (1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s}) & \ne 0,\\
        \left| (1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s})\right| &< \infty. 
    \end{align}
\end{assumption}


Suppose that the researcher observes the aggregate price $P$ and the aggregate quantity $Q$, and the vector of exogenous variables $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$.
Then, \citet{lau1982identifying} considers the identification problem of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function.
Based on the exogenous variables, the researcher can identify the reduced form of the equilibrium quantity $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$.
Given the inverse demand function, the reduced form of the equilibrium price is $P$, defined as $h_p(X^{d}, X^{s})$, is also identified.
We put this fact as an assumption:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:reduced_form_identification}
    The reduced form of the equilibrium quantity $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$ and the reduced form of the equilibrium price $P^e = h_p(X^{d}, X^{s})$ are identified from the data on price, quantity, and other exogenous variables.
\end{assumption}


\subsection{Non-identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function}\label{sec:definition_identification}
While we are interested in the conditions for the identification of the conduct parameter, \citet{lau1982identifying} takes an indirect approach and specifies the conditions under which the model is not identified.
The definition of non-identification is as follows:
\begin{definition}\label{definition:non_identification}
    Non-identification implies for any $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$,
    \begin{align}
    & P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) = MC(Q^e, X^{s}) ,  \label{eq:foc_alpha}\\
    & P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) = MC^{*}(Q^e, X^{s}),\label{eq:foc_beta}
    \end{align}
    where $\theta \neq \theta^{*}$, $MC \ne MC^{*}$, and the equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ has a reduced form functions $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$ and $Q^e = h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s})$ defined by \eqref{eq:foc_alpha} and \eqref{eq:foc_beta} respectively are identical.
\end{definition}
In other words, given two distinct pairs of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost, the equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ solves the equilibrium condition for both pairs.
Non-identification asks the following question: given an inverse demand function, is it possible to find two distinct pairs of a conduct parameter and a marginal cost that lead to observable equivalent equilibrium?


By taking the contraposition of Definition \ref{definition:non_identification}, we can also define the identification of the conduct parameter and marginal cost function:
\begin{definition}\label{definition:identification}
    Identification implies that for any two distinct pairs of conduct parameter and any marginal cost function, denoted as $(\theta, MC)$ and $(\theta^{*}, MC^{*})$, there exists a pair of demand shifter $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ where the equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ is different, that is, $h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) \ne h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s})$.
\end{definition}
The intuition is that identification means that given an economic condition, any different pairs of conduct parameters and marginal cost functions cannot lead to the same equilibrium quantity, that is, violates the observable equivalence of the equilibrium quantity.

Then, \citet{lau1982identifying} finds that the separability of the inverse demand function and non-identification are equivalent.
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem_lau}
    Given Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}, \ref{assumption:twice_differentiable}, and \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium},
    the conduct parameter $\theta$ cannot be identified from data on price, quantity, and other exogenous variables alone if and only if the industry inverse demand function is separable in $X^{d}$, that is,
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, h(X^{d})), \label{eq:separable_demand}
    \end{align}
    but not take the form, 
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, h(X^{d})) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}h(X^{d}) + k(Q). \label{eq:identification_separable_demand_lau}
    \end{align}
\end{theorem}
The inverse demand function satisfies \eqref{eq:separable_demand} has weak separability defined in \citet{goldmanNote1964}.\footnote{See Definition \ref{def:weal_separable} in Appendix \ref{appendix:summary_goldman_uzawa}.}
An important implication is that when the demand shifter is a scalar, by putting $h(X^{d})= X^{d}$, the inverse demand function \eqref{eq:separable_demand} can include any inverse demand with a scalar demand shifter.
Thus, the conduct parameter can be identified only when the inverse demand function takes the form \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand_lau} when the demand shifter is a scalar.
Therefore, the shape of the inverse demand function and the dimension of the demand shifter are important for the identification.




\section{Characterization of Non-identification}\label{sec:non-identification_characterization}

First, we characterizes the non-identification condition based on Definition \ref{definition:non_identification} by following the proof of necessary condition in \citet{lau1982identifying}.
Note that observable equivalence implies that the reduced form of the equilibrium quantity $h_q$ and $h_q^{*}$ are identical for any $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$.
Therefore, its derivative with respect to the demand and cost shifters, $\nabla h_q$ and $\nabla h_q^{*}$, should be also identical.
Then, by applying the implicit function theorem to the equilibrium condition, we can compute $\nabla h_q$ and $\nabla h_q^{*}$, and hence we can derive the following proposition:
\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:non-identification_charaterization}
    Non-identification implies that for any $X^{d}$, $X^{s}$, and $Q^e$ under these exogenous variables, we have for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$,
    \begin{align}
        &\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})\\  
        &= \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})\left[ \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) \right], \label{eq:nonidentification_demand}
    \end{align}
    and for $j = 1,\ldots, K_s$,
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}) = \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) \frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}),\label{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost}
    \end{align}
    where $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ is defined as
    \begin{align}
        \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) \equiv \frac{(1+\theta^{*})\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}. \label{eq:lambda_foc}
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}
See Appendix \ref{appendix:proof} for the proof.
This proposition comes from the proof of necessary condition in \citet{lau1982identifying}.
However, while he uses the same logic, he ignores the fact that $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ depends on $X^{d}$ and obtains the following equation similar to \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost}:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q, X^{s}) = \lambda'(Q, X^{s}) \frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q, X^{s}),\quad \forall Q, X^{s}, \label{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost_lau}
\end{align}
where $\lambda'(Q, X^{s})$ depends on $Q$ and $X^{s}$ but not $X^{d}$, and then he concludes that there is a transformation $T$ such that 
\begin{align}
    MC^{*}(Q, X^{s}) = T(MC(Q, X^{s}), Q). \label{eq:mc_transformation_lau}
\end{align}
The existence of the transformation $T$ is shown by integrating \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost_lau} with respect to $X^{s}$ when $X^{s}$ is a scalar, and by applying Lemma \ref{lemma_1_GU} from \citet{goldmanNote1964} when $X^{s}$ is a vector.

His argument has some problems.
First, 


His argument is correct as long as $\lambda(Q, X^{d}, X^{s})$ does not depend on $X^{d}$, but when not, $MC^{*}$ recovered by \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_lau} needs to depend on $X^{d}$, which is not allowed because the marginal cost function should be independent of $X^{d}$ by Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}.




\subsection{Alternative Characterization of Non-identification}
To resolve the problems in \citet{lau1982identifying}, we provide a new characterization of non-identification based on both \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} and \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost}.
First, for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$, we rewrite \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} as
\begin{align}
    \frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) }{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) } = \frac{(1+\theta^{*})\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}.
\end{align}
Note that Assumption \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium} guarantees that the right-hand side is well-defined.
We also need to check that the left-hand side is well-defined, but temporarily we ignore this issue and
assume that the left-hand side is well-defined.
We discuss this point in detail later.
Then, by rearranging this equation based on the derivative of $MC$ and $MC^{*}$ with respect to $Q$, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}) =D_i(Q^e, X^{d}) + C_i(Q^e, X^{d})\frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}),\label{eq:mc_transformation_quantity}
\end{align}
where $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ are defined as
\begin{align}
    C_i(Q, X^{d}) \equiv \frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) }{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) },\label{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    &D_i(Q, X^{d})\\
    &\equiv\frac{(\theta^{*} - \theta)\Bigg[\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) + Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q, X^{d})\right) \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) - Q \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_i\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) \Bigg]}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d})}.\label{eq:intercation_derivative_demand}
\end{align}
%This can be more simplified as (we suppress the arguments of the functions for brevity),
%\begin{align}
    %&(1+ \theta^{*})\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2} - \frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q} }{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q} }\left[(1+ \theta) \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}\right]\\
    %&= \frac{1}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}Q}\left[\left((1 + \theta^{*}) \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial  Q^2}\right)\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}\right)\right]\\
    %&\quad - \frac{1}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}Q}\left[\left( (1 + \theta) \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}\right)\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}\right)\right]\\
    %& = 
%\end{align}
Next, \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} and \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost} imply that for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ and $j = 1, \ldots, K_s$,
\begin{align}
    \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) =  \frac{\frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s})}{\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s})} =  \frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) }{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})},
\end{align}
and from the second equality, we have for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ and $j = 1, \ldots, K_s$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}) = C_i(Q^e, X^{d})\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}).\label{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter}
\end{align}
Because \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} come from \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} and \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost}, they are also the necessary conditions for non-identification.
Therefore, we have a new characterization of non-identification as follows:
\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:necessary_nonidentification}
    Non-identification implies that for any $X^{d}$, $X^{s}$, and $Q^e$ under these exogenous variables, we have \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} such that
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}) =D_i(Q^e, X^{d}) + C_i(Q^e, X^{d})\frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})
    \end{align}
    and
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}) = C_i(Q^e, X^{d})\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}),
    \end{align} 
    for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$, $j = 1, \ldots, K_s$. The definition of $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ is given by \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} and \eqref{eq:intercation_derivative_demand}, respectively.
\end{proposition}
This characterization gives the information about how the derivative of $MC$ and $MC^{*}$ with respect to $Q$ and $X^{s}$ at the equilibrium quantity are related and tells more about what happens when non-identification holds than \cite{lau1982identifying}.
First, while Lau uses only \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost} which is the derivative with respect to $X^{s}$, this characterization uses the relationship between $MC$ and $MC^{*}$ with respect to both $Q$ and $X^{s}$.

Second, this characterization can restrict the form of the inverse demand function that leads to non-identification.
Note that \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} imply that given any conduct parameters $\theta$ and $\theta^{*}$, and a marginal cost function $MC$, marginal cost function $MC^{*}$ can be constructed based on \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter}.
However, \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} do not necessary leads to a valid marginal cost function because $C_i(Q^e, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q^e, X^{d})$ are functions of $Q^e$ and $X^{d}$.
Therefore, the left-hand side of \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} can be a function of $X^{d}$.
However, this violates the Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters} that $X^{d}$ is a vector of exclusive demand shifters.
Therefore, to have a valid marginal cost function $MC^{*}$, $C_i$ and $D_i$ should be independent of $X^{d}$.
Additionally, while we index $C_i$ and $D_i$ by $i$, the change in $X^{d}_i$ should not affect the change in $MC^{*}$.





So far, we have implicitly assumed that $C_i$ and $D_i$ are well-defined.
However, this is not always the case because the denominator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} can be zero and hence $C_i$ and $D_i$ take infinite values.
When this happens, the necessary condition in Proposition \ref{proposition:necessary_nonidentification} is not satisfied, which implies that the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function are identified.
In fact, the condition that the denominator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} is not zero restricts the class of inverse demand functions that always leads to identification.
We state this result as follows:
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:identification_condition_separable}
    When $\theta \ne 0$, $C_i$ and $D_i$ are not well-defined because the denominator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} is zero, that is, 
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) = 0. \label{eq:identification_condition_separable}
    \end{align}
    Therefore, under this inverse demand function, the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function are identified.
    Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the set of demand shifters where \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} holds.
    Then, \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} leads to the inverse demand function such that
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}h(X^{d}) + k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}), \label{eq:identification_separable_demand}
    \end{align}
    where $X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}$ is the vector of demand shifters whose index is not in $\mathcal{I}$.
    The numerator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} is always nonzero under \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand}.
\end{lemma}
See Appendix \ref{appendix:proof} for the proof.
Note that \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial X^{d}_i}\left( P(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d})\right) = 0,
\end{align}
which is the derivative of the marginal revenue under $\theta$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$.
Thus, \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} implies that the marginal revenue is not affected by $X^{d}_i$.
Additionally, the equilibrium condition \eqref{eq:foc_alpha} becomes
\begin{align}
    k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) + \theta Qk'(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) = MC(Q, X^{s}),
\end{align}
which implies that the equilibrium quantity is not affected by the change in $X^{d}_i$.
Therefore, under \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand}, all demand shifters whose index is in $\mathcal{I}$ work as a demand rotation instrument when the conduct parameter is $\theta$.
On the other hands, for any other conduct parameter $\theta^{*}$, the marginal revenue is always affected by $X^{d}_i$.
Therefore, the observable equivalence is always violated.




\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:three_times_differentiable}
    The inverse demand function $P(Q, X^{d})$ is three times continuously differentiable with respect to $Q$ and $X^{d}$.
    The marginal cost function $MC(Q, X^{s})$ is twice continuously differentiable with respect to $Q$ and $X^{s}$.
\end{assumption}









\begin{example}\label{example:bresnahan_1982}
    Consider a linear demand such that
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, X^{d}) = \alpha_0 - \alpha_1Q + \alpha_2X^{d}.
    \end{align}
    Then, \eqref{eq:mc_transformation} is given as
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}) = (\theta^{*} - \theta)\alpha_1 + \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}).
    \end{align}
    This implies that $MC^{*}$ can be independent of $X^{d}$ and the following $MC^{*}$ leads to observationally equivalent to $MC$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}\label{example:log_linear}
    Consider a nonlinear demand such that
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, X^{d}) = \exp(\alpha_0)Q^{-\alpha_1}(X^{d})^{\alpha_2}
    \end{align}
    This leads to a log-linear inverse demand function,
    \begin{align}
        \log P(Q, X^{d} ) = \alpha_0 - \alpha_1 \log Q + \alpha_2 \log X^{d}.
    \end{align}
    Then \eqref{eq:mc_transformation} is given as
    \begin{align}
        \frac{MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s}) = \frac{1 - \theta^{*} \alpha_1}{1 - \theta \alpha_1} \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s}). 
    \end{align}
    Thus, $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ is vanished and $C_i(Q,X^{d})$ does not depend on $X^{d}$, which implies that we can construct a new marginal cost $MC^{*}$ that leads to observable equivalent equilibrium to $MC$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{example:demand_counterexample}
    Consider the linear demand given by \eqref{eq:demand_counterexample}.
    Then, \eqref{eq:mc_transformation} is given by
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s}) = (\theta^{*} - \theta)(-\alpha_1 + \alpha_3X^{d}) +  \frac{\alpha_2 + \theta\alpha_3Q}{\alpha_2 + \theta^{*}\alpha_3Q}\frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s}).
    \end{align}
    This implies that any new marginal cost function $MC^{*}$ that is observationally equivalent to the given marginal cost function $MC$ should depend on the demand shifter, which is not allowed by the Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}.
    Section \ref{sec:identification_example} considers the case with linear marginal cost function, but this intuition holds for any marginal cost function $MC$.
\end{example}









Now, given that \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} does not hold, we characterize the class of inverse demand functions that makes $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ independent of $X^{d}$.
\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:non-identification_inverse_demand}
    Suppose that \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} does not hold.
    $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ are independent of $X^{d}$ implies that the inverse demand function is given as
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + k(Q). \label{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}
    \end{align}
    where $\alpha_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ is a constant.
\end{proposition}
See Appendix \ref{appendix:proof} for the proof.


It is easy to verify that the inverse demand function in Example \ref{example:bresnahan_1982} and \ref{example:log_linear} satisfies \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}, but Example \ref{example:demand_counterexample} does not.
Additionally, when $X^{d}$ is a vector, non-additivity of $X^{d}$ can lead to identification.
Based on Lemma \ref{lemma:identification_condition_separable}, when $X^{d}$ is a scalar, $\alpha_1 = -\frac{1}{\theta}$ leads to the inverse demand \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}, which should be excluded so as not to lead to identification.
Note that from Lemma \ref{lemma:identification_condition_separable}, $\alpha_1 \ne -\frac{1}{\theta}$ must hold.



Now, we switch to the sufficient condition.
Suppose that we have a transformation $T$ of the marginal revenue and the marginal cost under $(\theta, MC)$ and $(\theta^{*}, MC^{*})$:
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) = T\left(P(Q, X^{d}) + \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}), Q\right)
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    MC(Q, X^{s}) = T\left(MC(Q, X^{s}), Q\right).
\end{align}
Then, when an equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ satisfies the equilibrium condition under $(\theta, MC)$, $Q^e$ also satisfies the equilibrium condition under $(\theta^{*}, MC^{*})$ because by using the transformation, we have that
\begin{align}
    T\left(P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}), Q^e\right)&= T\left(MC(Q^e, X^{s}), Q^e\right)\\
    P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})&= MC^{*}(Q^e, X^{s}).
\end{align}
This implies that given a conduct parameter $\theta$ and a marginal cost function $MC$, for any conduct parameter $\theta^{*}$, we can construct a new marginal cost function $MC^{*}$ and transform the marginal revenue under $\theta$ to the marginal revenue under $\theta^{*}$ so that observable equivalence holds between $(\theta, MC)$ and $(\theta^{*}, MC^{*})$.
Therefore, we are interested in whether \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand} can lead to such a transformation.
In fact, \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} can give us the transformation under \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}, which implies that the inverse demand function \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand} can lead to non-identification.
We state this result as a proposition and the proof is given in Appendix \ref{appendix:proof}:
\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:sufficient_nonidentification}
    Suppose that $\alpha_1 \ne -\frac{1}{\theta}$. The inverse demand function \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand} is a sufficient condition for non-identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function.
\end{proposition}

In summary, we have the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:identification_characterization}
    Given Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}, \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium}, and \ref{assumption:three_times_differentiable}, the conduct parameter $\theta$ cannot be identified from data on price, quantity, and other exogenous variables alone if and only if the industry inverse demand function is given as \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand} but not $\alpha_1 = -\frac{1}{\theta}$.
\end{theorem}
When $\alpha_1 \ne 0$, the demand shifter changes only the slope of the inverse demand function, but not the intercept.
When $\alpha_1 = 0$, the demand shifter changes only the intercept of the inverse demand function, but not the slope.
Therefore, we cannot have a variation in $X^{d}$ that works as a demand rotation instrument.
The difference between Theorem \ref{theorem_lau} is that our theorem also allows the identification when the demand shifter is a scalar, but when the demand shifter does not include any demand rotation instrument, the identification does not hold.






\section{Identification of the inverse demand function}

So far, by following \citet{lau1982identifying}, we have considered the identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function given the inverse demand function.
However, 





\section{We can identify the conduct parameter even when the demand function is separable}\label{sec:identification_example}





We first show that the identification result in \citet{lau1982identifying} is incorrect by providing a counterexample where a separable demand function induces identification.

The intuition is the following.
Consider a linear demand with a demand rotation instrument, given by
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = \alpha_0 - \alpha_1Q + \alpha_2X^{d} + \alpha_3QX^{d}. \label{eq:demand_counterexample}
\end{align}
Because the demand shifter is a scalar, the inverse demand function satisfies \eqref{eq:demand_separable}.
Here, the demand shifter is works as a demand rotation instrument introduced in \citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} to identify the conduct parameter.
\citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} considers the linear demand and the linear marginal cost function, but let's see why the demand rotation instrument works even when a more general environment.
Suppose that the true conduct is the perfect competition, that is, $\theta = 0$ and the alternative conduct is the monopoly, that is, $\theta^{*} = 1$.
The true and alternative marginal cost functions are also given as linear functions.

Figure \ref{fig:identification_example} illustrates the intuition.
Figure \ref{fig:identification_example_step_1} illustrates the non-identification result.
When the true conduct is the perfect competition, the equilibrium point is $E$, but the marginal revenue under the monopoly, $MR^{*}$, and the marginal cost $MC^{*}$ leads to the same equilibrium point $E$.
Now, let's consider the change in the demand rotation instrument.
In Figure \ref{fig:identification_example_step_2}, the demand rotation changes the intercept and slope of the demand function without changing the equilibrium point under the true model.
Then, under the monopoly, the new equilibrium point is $E^{*}$, which is different from $E$ and hence the observable equivalence is violated.

When $MC^{*}$ leads to the same equilibrium point $E$ after the change in the demand rotation, $MC^{*}$ should shift as in Figure \ref{fig:identification_example_step_3_1} and \ref{fig:identification_example_step_3_2}.
However, this cannot be done by the cost shifter because if this does by a cost shifter, it also changes the true marginal cost function $MC$.
Therefore, the shift in $MC^{*}$ should correlate with the change in the demand rotation, which implies that $MC^{*}$ should be a function of the demand shifter.
This is impossible because it violates Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}.

Here, we consider the case $MC^{*}$ is also a linear function.
Non-identification requires to find two distinct pairs of conduct parameter and marginal cost function that lead to the same equilibrium quantity, and hence there is a possibility that under non-linear $MC$ and $MC^{*}$, $MC^{*}$ can achieve observable equivalence without depending on the demand shifter.
However, as we will see later, this is impossible under the inverse demand and the same intuition applies.

    In step 2, the demand rotation changes the intercept and slope of the demand function without changing the equilibrium point under perfect competition, but changes the equilibrium point under monopoly.
    Step 3 illustrates that to keep the equilibrium point under monopoly, $MC^{*}$ should change along with the demand rotation, which is impossible because the marginal cost function is independent of the demand shifter.

\section{Conclusion and Discussion}

We present a counterexample to \citet{lau1982identifying}'s identification result, separability does not imply non-identification.
Our finding is that even though non-identification implies the separability of the inverse demand function, the class of separable inverse demand functions that leads to non-identification is more restricted than the class considered in \citet{lau1982identifying}.

Based on the recent literature on distinguishing firm conduct, this result is not surprising.
For example, in the differentiated product environment, \citet{berry2014identification}  use a broader variation in markets to distinguish conduct beyond demand rotation.
In our counterexample, to violate observable equivalence, we need a variation in $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ that leads to a specific equilibrium quantity.
Of course, homogeneous product settings are more restricted than differentiated product settings, but it sounds too strong to claim that any separable demand function is a necessary and sufficient condition for non-identification of the conduct parameter.
Rather, even though the true inverse demand function is separable, the variation in markets may help to identify the conduct parameter.

In this note, we have not investigated the exact class of separable inverse demand functions that leads to non-identification of the conduct parameter.
However, in practice, this does not matter much because to estimate the conduct parameter, the researcher uses a parametric assumption on the inverse demand function and the marginal cost function (e.g., \citet{okazaki2022excess} and \citet{matsumura2024loglinear}).
Even though the researcher wants to non-parametrically estimate the marginal cost function, at least a non-separable demand function leads to the identification of the conduct parameter.

\section{Omitted Proofs}\label{appendix:proof}
In this section, we provide the proofs of the lemmas and theorems in the main text.
In what follows, we suppress the arguments of functions when no confusion arises.


\subsection{Proof of Proposition \ref{proposition:non-identification_charaterization}}
Assume that given $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, we can solve the equilibrium condition for the equilibrium quantity $Q^e$.
For notational simplicity, we define
\begin{align}
    F(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) \equiv P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) - MC(Q^e, X^{s}).
\end{align}
Then, by Assumption \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium}, we can apply the implicit function theorem, and for the reduced-form equation $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$, the gradient of the reduced-form function $h_q$ with respect to $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \nabla h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) =  \left( -\dfrac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{m}_{i}}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})} \right)_{\substack{m = d, s\\ i = 1, \ldots, K_m}}. \label{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply}
\end{align}
The derivatives of $F$ for each variable are
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) & =  \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})Q^e, \quad i = 1, \ldots, K_d,\\
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) & =  -\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{s}), \quad i = 1, \ldots, K_s, \\
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) & = (1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}).
\end{align}
Thus, the derivative of $h$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$ and $X^{s}_i$ are given as for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ and $i = 1, \ldots, K_s$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(X^{d}, X^{s}) = -\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) }{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta  Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}, \label{eq:foc_derivative_demand}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{s}_{i}}(X^{d}, X^{s}) & = \frac{\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{s})}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta  Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}. \label{eq:foc_derivative_supply}
\end{align}

% Use the definition of non-identification
Note that the same argument can be applied to the equilibrium condition \eqref{eq:foc_beta} of the alternative model.
Recall that the non-identification implies that $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) = h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s})$ for all $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, and hence we must have
\begin{align}
    \nabla h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s}) = \nabla h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) \quad \forall X^{d}, X^{s}. \label{eq:observale_equivalence_derivative}
\end{align}
From \eqref{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply}, this implies that for all $Q^e$, $X^{d}$, and $X^{s}$,
\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{K_d}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{K_s}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{K_d}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{K_s}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)
    \end{pmatrix},\label{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply_lambda}
\end{align}
where $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ is defined as
\begin{align}
    \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) \equiv \frac{(1+\theta^{*})\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}.
\end{align}
Assumption \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium} guarantees that $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ is nonzero and finite.
From the first $K_d$ rows in \eqref{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply_lambda}, \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} and for the later $K_s$ rows, \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost} hold.





\subsection{Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma:identification_condition_separable}}
Note that when $\theta = 0$, \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} implies that $\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = 0$ for any $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$.
This cannot be held because it violates Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}.
Therefore, we assume that $\theta \ne 0$.
Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the set of the indices of the elements in $X^{d}$ that satisfy \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable}.

For all $i \in \mathcal{I}$, from \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable}, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial Q}\log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = -\frac{1}{\theta Q}.
\end{align}
By integrating both sides with respect to $Q$, we have
\begin{align}
    \log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = -\frac{1}{\theta}\log Q + H_i(X^{d}),
\end{align}
where $H_i(X^{d})$ is a function of $X^{d}$.
By taking the exponential of both sides, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = h_i(X^{d})Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}},
\end{align}
where $h_i(X^{d})  = \exp(H_i(X^{d}))$.
Note that this is a derivative of $P$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$ and is a separable function of $Q$ and $X^{d}$, 
it is natural to think that $h_i(X^{d})$ is a derivative of a function of $X^{d}$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$.
In other words, there is a function $h(X^{d})$ of $X^{d}$ such that $h_i(X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i}$ holds.
Therefore, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i} Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}.
\end{align}

By integrating both sides with respect to $X^{d}_i$, we have
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}h(X^{d}) + k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i}), \quad i \in \mathcal{I}, \label{eq:identification_separable_demand_i}
\end{align}
where $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is a function of $Q$ and $X^{d}_{-i}$ and $X^{d}_{-i}$ is the vector of $X^{d}$ excluding $X^{d}_i$.
When $X^{d}$ is a scalar, there is no argument in $X^{d}_{-i}$, and hence we can remove the index of $i$.
Therefore, $k(Q, X^{d}_{-i}) = k(Q)$ holds, and hence we have \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand}.

When $X^{d}$ is a vector and $|\mathcal{I}| = 1$, we can remove the index of $i$ for notational simplicity.
If $|\mathcal{I}| > 1$, we can remove the index of $k_i$ in the following way.
Pick up any $i$ and $j$ in $\mathcal{I}$ such that $i \ne j$, and then the derivative of \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand_i} with respect to $X^{d}_j$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_j}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_j} Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}} + \frac{\partial k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})}{\partial X^{d}_j},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_j}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_j} Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}.
\end{align}
Therefore, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})}{\partial X^{d}_j} = 0,
\end{align} 
which implies that $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is independent of $X^{d}_j$.
By applying the same argument to all $i \in \mathcal{I}$, we can show that $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is independent of the demand shifters whose indices are in $\mathcal{I}$.
Let $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}})$ be the resulting function where $X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}$ is the vector of $X^{d}$ excluding the elements whose indices are in $\mathcal{I}$.
Then, by comparing \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand_i} for all $i \in \mathcal{I}$, we have
\begin{align}
    k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) = k_j(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) \quad \forall i,j \in \mathcal{I},
\end{align}
which implies that $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) = k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}})$ for all $i \in \mathcal{I}$.
Therefore, we have that
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}h(X^{d}) + k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}).
\end{align}
Note that when $|\mathcal{I}| = 1$, $X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}} = X^{d}_{-i}$, and hence the demand function can keep consistency with the case when $|\mathcal{I}| = 1$.


Next, we check whether the numerator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} is nonzero.
By substituting the above inverse demand function into the numerator, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta^{*}\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d})Q  &= Q^{-1/\theta} h_i(X^d) - \frac{\theta^{*}}{\theta^{*}} Q^{-1/\theta-1} h_i(X^d) Q\\
    &= Q^{-1/\theta} h_i(X^d) \left(1 - \frac{\theta}{\theta^{*}} \right).
\end{align}
By Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}, we have $h_i(X^d) \ne 0$.
Therefore, as $\theta \ne \theta^{*}$, the numerator is nonzero, which implies that $C_i = \infty$.


\subsection{Proof of Proposition \ref{proposition:non-identification_inverse_demand}}


Because $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ should be independent of $X^{d}$ simultaneously, we can first characterize the class of inverse demand functions that make $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ independent of $X^{d}$.
Then, we characterize the class of inverse demand functions that make $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ independent of $X^{d}$ by substituting the derived inverse demand function into $D_i(Q, X^{d})$.

\subsubsection*{Step 1}
When $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ is independent of $X^{d}$, the derivative of $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ with respect to $X^{d}$ is zero.
Let $u_i(Q, X^{d}) \equiv \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})$.
Then, the derivative of $C_i$ with respect to $X^{d}_j$ for $j = 1, \ldots, K_d$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial X^{d}_j}(Q, X^{d}) & = \frac{(\theta^{*} - \theta)Q }{\left(u_i + \theta Q \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial Q}\right)^2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j\partial Q} u_i - \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial Q} \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j}\right).
\end{align}
Note that because \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} does not hold, the denominator is not zero.
Therefore, the derivative becomes zero if and only if
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j\partial Q} u_i - \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial Q} \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j} = 0.
\end{align}
Note that 
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial^2 \log u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j \partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) & = \frac{\partial }{\partial Q}\left(\frac{1}{u_i}\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j}\right) = \frac{1}{u_i^2}\left(u_i\frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j \partial Q} - \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j}\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial Q}\right).
\end{align}
Because Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters} guarantees that $u_i \ne 0$, it is sufficient to solve the partial differential equation, for any $i,j = 1, \ldots, K_d$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial X^{d}_j \partial Q}\log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = 0.
\end{align}
This implies that $\frac{\partial }{\partial Q}\log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right)$ is independent of any element in $X^{d}$, and hence
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial Q}\log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = G(Q).
\end{align}

By integrating both sides with respect to $Q$, we have for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$,
\begin{align}
    \log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = \int G(Q) dQ + H_i(X^{d}).
\end{align}
As for the last term, by taking the integral by $Q$, we must have an arbitrary function of $X^{d}$ as an analogue of the constant of integration as $P$ is a function of $Q$ and $X^{d}$.
By taking exponential both side, we have for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \exp(H_i(X^{d})) \exp\left(\int G(Q) dQ\right) \equiv h_i(X^{d}) g(Q).
\end{align}
Because this derivative is a separable function of $Q$ and $X^{d}$, it is natural to think that $h_i(X^{d})$ is a derivative of a function of $X^{d}$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$.
In other words, there is a function $h(X^{d})$ of $X^{d}$ such that $h_i(X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i}$ holds.
Therefore, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i} g(Q).
\end{align}

By taking the integration with respect to $X^{d}_i$ on both sides, we have
\begin{align}
   P(Q, X^{d}) = g(Q) h(X^{d}) + k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i}), \quad i = 1, \ldots, K_d, \label{eq:inverse_demand_separable_step1}
\end{align}
where $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is an arbitrary function of $Q$ and $X^{d}_{-i}$ and $X^{d}_{-i}$ is the vector of $X^{d}$ excluding $X^{d}_i$.
When $X^{d}$ is a scalar, there is no argument in $X^{d}_{-i}$, and hence we can remove the index of $i$, that is, $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i}) = k(Q)$.
When $X^{d}$ is a vector, we can remove the index of $k_i$ in the following way.
Pick up an $i$, and then the derivative of \eqref{eq:inverse_demand_separable_step1} with respect to $X^{d}_i$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i} g(Q),
\end{align}
and for any other $j \ne i$, the same derivative is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i} g(Q) + \frac{\partial k_j(Q, X^{d}_{-j})}{\partial X^{d}_i}.
\end{align}
This implies that
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial k_j(Q, X^{d}_{-j})}{\partial X^{d}_i} = 0 \quad \text{for all } j \ne i.
\end{align}
Therefore, $k_j(Q, X^{d}_{-j})$ is independent of $X^{d}_i$, and hence $k_j$ is independent of $X^{d}_j$ and $X^{d}_i$.
By applying the same argument to all $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$, we can show that $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is independent of $X^{d}_{-i}$, that is, $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i}) = k_i(Q)$.
By comparing \eqref{eq:inverse_demand_separable_step1} for all $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$, it is easy to see that $k_i(Q) = k_j(Q)$ for any $i,j = 1, \ldots, K_d$, that is, we have a function $k(Q)$ such that $k_i(Q) = k(Q)$.
Therefore, $P(Q, X^{d})$ must be of the form
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = h(X^{d})g(Q) + k(Q).
\end{align}




\subsubsection*{Step 2}
Next, given the inverse demand function, we further specify the form of the inverse demand function based on $D_i(Q, X^{d})$.
By substituting the inverse demand function into $D_i(Q, X^{d})$, we have
\begin{align}
    D_i(Q, X^{d}) = &\frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{h_i(X^{d})(g(Q) + \theta Q g'(Q))}\Bigg[
    (g'(Q)h_i(X^{d}) + k'(Q) )g(Q)h_i'(X^{d})\\
    & \hspace{4.5cm} + Q(g''(Q)h_i(X^{d}) + k''(Q))g(Q)h_i(X^{d}) \\
    &\hspace{5cm} - Q(g'(Q)h(X^{d}) + k'(Q))g'(Q)h_i(X^{d})\Bigg]\\
    =&  \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{g(Q) + \theta Q g'(Q)}\Bigg[h(X^{d})(g'(Q)g(Q) + Qg{''}(Q)g(Q) - Q (g'(Q))^{2})\\
    & \hspace{4.5cm} + k'(Q)g(Q) + Qk''(Q)g(Q) - Qk'(Q)g'(Q)\Bigg].
\end{align}
The dependence of $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ on $X^{d}$ comes only from the first term in the bracket.
Therefore, $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ is independent of $X^{d}$ if and only if
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial h}{\partial X^{d}_i}(X^{d})(g'(Q)g(Q) + Qg{''}(Q)g(Q) - Q (g'(Q))^{2}) = 0.
\end{align}
However, Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters} implies that the derivative of $h(X^{d})$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$ is nonzero.
Therefore, we must have 
\begin{align}
    g'(Q)g(Q) + Qg{''}(Q)g(Q) - Q (g'(Q))^{2} = 0.
\end{align}
Let $v(Q) = \frac{g'(Q)}{g(Q)}$.
Because $v'(Q) = \frac{g''(Q)g(Q) - (g'(Q))^2}{g(Q)^2}$, we have
\begin{align}
    v(Q) + Qv'(Q) = 0.
\end{align}
This is a first-order linear differential equation.
Then, 
\begin{align}
    \frac{d }{d Q}\log v(Q) = -\frac{1}{Q}.
\end{align}
Integrating both sides with respect to $Q$, we have
\begin{align}
    \log v(Q) = -\log Q + a_1,
\end{align}
where $a_1$ is a constant.
By taking the exponential of both sides, we have
\begin{align}
    v(Q) = \frac{\alpha_1}{Q}, 
\end{align}
where $\alpha_1 = \exp(a_1)$.
By using the definition of $v(Q)$, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{d }{d Q}\log g(Q) = \alpha_1\frac{d}{dQ}\log Q.
\end{align}
Again, by integrating both sides with respect to $Q$, we have
\begin{align}
    \log g(Q) = \alpha_1\log Q + a_2,
\end{align}
where $a_2$ is a constant.
By taking the exponential of both sides, we have
\begin{align}
    g(Q) = \alpha_2Q^{\alpha_1},
\end{align}
where $\alpha_2 = \exp(a_2)$.
In summary, when $C_i$ and $D_i$ are independent of $X^{d}$, the inverse demand function must be of the form
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + k(Q).
\end{align}
Here, we absorb $\alpha_2$ into $h(\cdot)$.






\subsection{Proof of Proposition \ref{proposition:sufficient_nonidentification}}
Under the inverse demand function \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}, $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ are given by
\begin{align}
    C_i(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{Q^{\alpha_1}h'(X^{d}) + \theta^{*}\alpha_1Q^{\alpha_1}h'(X^{d})}{Q^{\alpha_1}h'(X^{d}) + \theta \alpha_1 Q^{\alpha_1}h'(X^{d})} = \frac{1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1}{1 + \theta\alpha_1}.
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    D_i(Q, X^{d}) & = \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{Q^{\alpha_1} + \theta \alpha_1Q^{\alpha_1}} \left[ k'(Q)Q^{\alpha_1} + Qk''(Q) Q^{\alpha_1} - k'(Q)\alpha_1Q^{\alpha_1} \right]\\
    &= \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \left[\frac{d}{dQ}Qk'(Q)  -\alpha_1k'(Q) \right].
\end{align}
Then, consider a transformation of the derivative of a function $f(Q, X)$ with respect to $Q$,
\begin{align}
    T_Q\left(f(Q,X), Q\right) \equiv \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{1 + \theta\alpha_1}\left[\frac{d}{dQ}Qk'(Q)  -\alpha_1k'(Q) \right]+ \frac{1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial Q}(Q, X).
\end{align}
This can be integrated with respect to $Q$, and hence we obtain a transformation of $f(Q, X)$ as
\begin{align}
    T\left(f(Q,X), Q\right) \equiv \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \left[Qk'(Q) - \alpha_1k(Q) \right] + \frac{1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} f(Q, X).
\end{align}

First, by substituting a marginal cost $MC$ into $T$, we can obtain a new marginal cost $MC^{*}$.
Second, by substituting the marginal revenue under $\theta$ into $T$, we have
\begin{align}
    & \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \left[Qk'(Q) - \alpha_1k(Q) \right] + \frac{1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \left[(1+\theta\alpha_1) Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + k(Q) + \theta Qk'(Q)\right]\\
    = & (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1)Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + \frac{(\theta^{*} - \theta + (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1)\theta)Qk'(Q) + (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1 - (\theta^{*} - \theta)\alpha_1) k(Q)}{1 + \theta\alpha_1}\\
    = & (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1)Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + \frac{(1 + \theta\alpha_1) k(Q) + \theta^{*}(1 + \theta\alpha_1)Qk'(Q) }{1 + \theta\alpha_1}\\
    = & (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1)Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) +k(Q) + \theta^{*}Qk'(Q),
\end{align}
where the last line is the marginal revenue under $\theta^{*}$.
Therefore, under the inverse demand function, $T$ can connect the marginal revenue under the two models.
As the result, $T$ can connect the equilibrium conditions under the two models, which implies that the inverse demand function is a sufficient condition for the non-identification.



\section{A Summary of Goldman and Uzawa (1964)}\label{appendix:summary_goldman_uzawa}

Let $n$ be the number of variables and $x = (x_{1},\ldots, x_{n})$ be a vector of $n$ variables.
Consider a partition of $X$ into $K$ parts, $\{x^1, \ldots, x^K\}$ such that $X = \bigcup_{k=1}^K x^k$ and $x^k \cap x^l = \emptyset$ for $k\ne l$.
\begin{definition}\label{def:weal_separable}
    A function is weakly separable with respect to the partition if 
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x_l}\left(\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x^1, \ldots, x^K)}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x^1, \ldots, x^K)}\right) = 0, \quad i,j\in x^k, l \notin x^k.
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
This implies that the ratio of the derivative with respect to $x_i$ and $x_j$, which are in the same category, is not affected by the change in the variables in other partitions.
Intuitively, by taking the ratio, the component of $f$ relating to $x_l$ is canceled out, and hence the derivative of the ratio with respect to $x_l$ becomes zero.
When $f$ is a utility function, this implies that the marginal rate of substitution between commodity $i$ and $j$ in the same partition is independent of the quantities of commodities outside $x^k$.

Then, \citet{goldmanNote1964} specifies the functional form that a weak separable function should satisfy.
\begin{theorem}\label{thorem_2_GU}
    A function $f(x)$ is weakly separable with respect to a partition $\{x^1, .. ., x^K\}$ if and only if $f(x)$ is of the form: 
    \begin{align}
        f(X) = \Phi(r^1(x^{1}),\ldots, r^K(x^{K})   )
    \end{align} where $\Phi(r^1,\ldots, r^K)$ is a function of $K$ variables and, for each $k$, $r^k(x^{k})$ is a function subvector $x^{k}$ alone.
\end{theorem}

The next lemma is a key lemma in the proof of \citet{lau1982identifying}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma_1_GU}
    Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be two continuously twice-differentiable functions of $n$ variables $x=(x_1, \dots, x_n)$. If each indifference surface is connected, and if there exists a function $\lambda(x)$ such that
    \begin{align}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x) &= \lambda(x)\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x), \quad i=1, \dots, n, \quad \text{for all } x, \label{eq:transform_f}
    \end{align}
    then $f(x)$ is a transformation of $g(x)$; namely, there exists a function $T(\cdot)$ of one variable such that
    \begin{align}
    f(x) &= T(g(x)) \quad \text{for all } x.
    \end{align}
    Hence, in particular, the function $\lambda(x)$ satisfying \eqref{eq:transform_f} must be of the form:
    \begin{align}
        \lambda(x) &= \Lambda(g(x)) \quad \text{for all } x, \label{eq:form_of_lambda}
    \end{align}
    with some function $\Lambda(\cdot)$ of one variable.
\end{lemma}
If there is a function $T$ such that $f(x) = T(g(x))$, then by the chain rule, we have $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x) = T'(g(x))\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x)$ where $T'$ is the derivative of $T$.
Thus, by defining $\lambda(x) = T'(g(x))$, we have $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x) = \lambda(x)\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x)$.
Intuitively, the lemma implies that the converse of the chain rule holds under additional conditions.
