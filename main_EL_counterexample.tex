    Based on our characterization, we provide a new necessary and sufficient condition for the non-identification of the conduct parameter.
    This result implies that the class of inverse demand functions that lead to identification is much broader than \citet{lau1982identifying} considers.

\section{Introduction}
Measuring competitiveness is an important task in the empirical industrial organization literature.
The conduct parameter approach is one of the useful approaches to measure competitiveness.
However, the parameter cannot be directly measured from data because data generally lack information about marginal costs.
Therefore, researchers endeavor to identify and estimate conduct parameters.

As for the identification of conduct parameters in homogeneous goods markets, there are two influential papers.\footnote{In Google Scholar, the citation count of \citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} is 1765 and that of \citet{lau1982identifying} is 939 on April 28, 2025.}
First, \citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} considers the identification of conduct parameter and marginal cost function in linear demand and linear marginal cost model.
\citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} finds that when the inverse demand function includes a demand shifter, called demand rotation instrument, which changes the slope and intercept of the inverse demand function, the conduct parameter and the parameters of the marginal cost function can be identified.
Recently, \citet{matsumura2023resolving} provide a detailed condition for the identification.
Second, \citet{lau1982identifying} considers a more general setting and investigates the conditions under which the conduct parameter is not identified.
\citet{lau1982identifying} shows that the conduct parameter is not identified if and only if the demand function is separable, except a specific functional form.
As introducing demand rotation instrument makes a inverse demand function non-separable, this result implies that the insight of \citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} is crucial for the identification of conduct parameter in homogeneous goods markets even in a general setting.


The contributions of this paper are as follows. 
First, we point out that the proof of \citet{lau1982identifying} has some problems.
The key argument in his proof is that non-identification implies that there is a transformation between the equilibrium condition under two different models.
In other words, given an equilibrium quantity under a conduct parameter and a marginal cost function, we can construct a transformation that transforms the equilibrium condition under the given conduct parameter and marginal cost function into the equilibrium condition under another conduct parameter and another marginal cost function that satisfies the equilibrium quantity in both models.
This implies that we have two distinct pairs of a conduct parameter and a marginal cost that lead to observable equivalent equilibrium.
However, the way of finding such transformation is incorrect.

Next, to avoid the problem, we provide a novel characterization of non-identification to construct a transformation that connects the equilibrium condition under two different models.
To make the transformation work, we can restrict the functional form of the inverse demand function.
Surprisingly, the resulting class of inverse demand functions implied by non-identification is the set of inverse demand functions that are separable but more restrictive functional form.
Additionally, we find that the class of inverse demand functions also works as a sufficient condition for non-identification.
Therefore, the class of inverse demand functions that lead to identification is much broader than \citet{lau1982identifying} considers.


The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section \ref{sec:setting} describes the setting.
Section \ref{sec:nonidentification_characterization} provides a new characterization of non-identification and shows the necessary and sufficient condition for non-identification.
Appendix includes the omitted proofs in the main text and a summary of \citet{goldmanNote1964}.




\section{Setting}\label{sec:setting}

\subsection{Model and Assumptions}

Consider a homogeneous product market with the aggregate inverse demand and aggregate marginal cost function as $P(Q, X^{d})$ and $MC(Q, X^{s})$ where $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ are the vector of exogenous variables.
Let $K_d$ and $K_s$ be the dimension of $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, respectively.
We call $X^{d}$ demand shifters and $X^{s}$ cost shifters, and assume the following:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:exclusive_shifters}
    The demand shifter $X^{d}$ and the cost shifter $X^{s}$ are exclusive; that is, there is no common variable in $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, and $X^{d}$ affects the demand function but not the marginal cost function, and $X^{s}$ affects the marginal cost function but not the demand function; for all $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ and $j = 1, \ldots, K_s$,
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d}) \ne 0, \quad \frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_{j}}(Q, X^{s}) \ne 0, \quad \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{s}_{j}}(Q, X^{d}) = 0, \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{s}) = 0.
    \end{align}
\end{assumption}
We can also include some common variables in $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, but in that case, we must have at least one variable exclusive demand shifter and one variable exclusive cost shifter.
\citet{lau1982identifying} also imposes the following restriction on the inverse demand and the marginal cost function:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:twice_differentiable}
    The inverse demand and the marginal cost function are twice continuously differentiable.
\end{assumption}

The equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ is defined as the solution to the following equation:
\begin{align}
    P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) - MC(Q^e, X^{s}) = 0, \label{eq:foc}
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is called the conduct parameter.
Depending on the value of $\theta$, the relation can nest the equilibrium condition of several models, such as perfect competition ($\theta=0$) and Cournot competition ($\theta=1/N$).

\citet{lau1982identifying} does not impose any further restrictions, but it is natural to assume that the equilibrium quantity exists, which needs the following additional assumption:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:unique_equilibrium}
    Given an inverse demand function, a conduct parameter, and a marginal cost function, and given $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, the derivative of the equilibrium condition with respect to $Q$ is not zero \footnote{By Assumption \ref{assumption:twice_differentiable}, the derivative of the equilibrium condition with respect to $Q$ is finite.}, that is,
    \begin{align}
        (1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s}) & \ne 0.
    \end{align}
\end{assumption}


%Based on the exogenous variables, the researcher can identify the reduced form of the equilibrium quantity $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$.
%Given the inverse demand function, the reduced form of the equilibrium price is $P$, defined as $h_p(X^{d}, X^{s})$, is also identified.
%We put this fact as an assumption:
%\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:reduced_form_identification}
%    The reduced form of the equilibrium quantity $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$ and the reduced form of the equilibrium price $P^e = h_p(X^{d}, X^{s})$ are identified from the data on price, quantity, and other exogenous variables.
%\end{assumption}


\subsection{Non-identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function}\label{sec:definition_identification}
Suppose that the researcher observes the aggregate price $P$ and the aggregate quantity $Q$, and the vector of exogenous variables $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$.
Given the inverse demand function, we are interested in the identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function.
While the interest is the identification, we take an indirect approach and specifies the conditions under which the model is not identified.
The definition of non-identification is as follows:
\begin{definition}\label{definition:non_identification}
    The conduct parameter and the marginal cost function are not identified if and only if 
    there are two distinct pairs of conduct parameter and marginal cost function, denoted as $(\theta, MC)$ and $(\theta^{*}, MC^{*})$, and for any $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, there exist an equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ that satisfies both
    \begin{align}
    & P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) = MC(Q^e, X^{s}) ,  \label{eq:foc_alpha}\\
    & P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) = MC^{*}(Q^e, X^{s}).\label{eq:foc_beta}
    \end{align}
    The equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ has a reduced form functions $h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$ and $h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s})$ defined by \eqref{eq:foc_alpha} and \eqref{eq:foc_beta} respectively are identical.
\end{definition}
In other words, non-identification asks whether given an inverse demand function, it is possible to find two distinct pairs of a conduct parameter and a marginal cost function that lead to observable equivalent equilibrium.


By taking the contraposition of Definition \ref{definition:non_identification}, we can also define the identification of the conduct parameter and marginal cost function:
\begin{definition}\label{definition:identification}
    Identification implies that for any two distinct pairs of conduct parameter and any marginal cost function, there exists a pair of demand shifter $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ where the equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ is different, that is, $h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) \ne h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s})$.
\end{definition}
The intuition is that identification means that any different pairs of conduct parameters and marginal cost functions cannot lead to the same equilibrium quantity under some demand shifter and cost shifter, that is, violates the observable equivalence of the equilibrium quantity.





\section{Lau's Result}\label{sec:lau_result}
Based on the above setting, \citet{lau1982identifying} finds that the separability of the inverse demand function and non-identification are equivalent.
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem_lau}
    Given Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}, \ref{assumption:twice_differentiable}, and \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium},
    the conduct parameter $\theta$ cannot be identified from data on price, quantity, and other exogenous variables alone if and only if the industry inverse demand function is separable in the demand shifter \footnote{The inverse demand function satisfying \eqref{eq:separable_demand} has weak separability defined in \citet{goldmanNote1964}. See Definition \ref{def:weal_separable} in Appendix \ref{appendix:summary_goldman_uzawa}.}, that is,
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, h(X^{d})), \label{eq:separable_demand}
    \end{align}
    but not take the form, 
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, h(X^{d})) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}h(X^{d}) + k(Q). \label{eq:identification_separable_demand_lau}
    \end{align}
\end{theorem}
The result says that the shape of the inverse demand function and the dimension of the demand shifter are important for the identification.
First, when the inverse demand function is separable in the demand shifter, the conduct parameter is not identified.
For example, \citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} considers the inverse demand function such that 
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = \alpha_0 - \alpha_1Q + \alpha_2X^{d}_1 + \alpha_3QX^{d}_1 + \alpha_4X^{d}_2. \label{eq:demand_bresnahan}
\end{align}
where $X^{d}_1$ works as a demand rotation instrument because it changes the slope and intercept of the inverse demand function.
This inverse demand function is not separable in $X^{d}$ and hence the conduct parameter is identified.

Second, this theorem implies that when the demand shifter is a scalar, the inverse demand function \eqref{eq:separable_demand} can include any inverse demand with a scalar demand shifter by putting $h(X^{d})= X^{d}$.
Thus, when the demand shifter is a scalar, the conduct parameter can be identified only when the inverse demand function takes the form \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand_lau}.


\subsection{Discussion}
As for the second point, we have a different intuition.
Consider the following inverse demand function:
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = \alpha_0 - \alpha_1Q + \alpha_2X^{d}_1 + \alpha_3QX^{d}_1. \label{eq:demand_counterexample}
\end{align}
Here, we exclude $X^{d}_2$ from the demand shifter, and hence the demand shifter becomes a scalar.
But, $X^{d}_1$ works as a demand rotation instrument, and hence the inverse demand function is not separable in $X^{d}$.
Theorem \ref{theorem_lau} implies that the conduct parameter is not identified because $X^{d}$ is a scalar.
In other words, the identification is possible because of $X^{d}_2$.
However, $X^{d}_1$ still works as a demand rotation insturument, and hence the role of $X^{d}_2$ is almost negligible, which leads to a conflict with the result of \citet{lau1982identifying}.\footnote{For example, consider a linear marginal cost function, then we can find the path of $X^{d}_1$ that does not change the equilibrium quantity under the inverse demand \eqref{eq:demand_counterexample}.}
Unfortunately, Theorem \ref{theorem_lau} does not provide a clear explanation for this conflict.



Now, we revisit why demand rotation works to identify the conduct parameter.
Suppose that the inverse demand function is given by \eqref{eq:demand_counterexample} and that the true conduct is the perfect competition, that is, $\theta = 0$ and the alternative conduct is the monopoly, that is, $\theta^{*} = 1$.
The true and alternative marginal cost functions are also given as linear functions.
Figure \ref{fig:identification_example} illustrates this environment.
Note that the equilibrium quantity is determined by the intersection of the inverse demand function and the marginal cost $MC$ under perfect competition.
The equilibrium quantity under the monopoly is determined by the intersection of the marginal revenue $MR^{*}$ and the marginal cost function $MC^{*}$.

    \footnotesize
    Note: The figures illustrate the intuition of how the demand rotation instrument works to identify the conduct parameter.
    $MC$ is the true marginal cost function, and $MC^{*}$ is the marginal cost function that rationalizes the monopoly conduct.
    Step 1 illustrates monopoly and perfect competition are observationally equivalent.
    In step 2, the demand rotation changes the intercept and slope of the demand function without changing the equilibrium point under perfect competition, but changes the equilibrium point under monopoly.
    Step 3 illustrates that to keep the equilibrium point under monopoly, $MC^{*}$ should change along with the demand rotation, which is impossible because the marginal cost function is independent of the demand shifter.
\end{figure}


In Figure \ref{fig:identification_example_step_1}, the perfect competition and the monopoly leads to the same equilibrium $E$.
Then, consider the change in the demand rotation instrument $X^{d}_1$.
In Figure \ref{fig:identification_example_step_2}, the demand rotation changes the intercept and slope of the demand function without changing the equilibrium point under the true model.
Under the monopoly, the new equilibrium point is $E^{*}$, which is different from $E$ and hence the observable equivalence is violated.
So as to lead to the same equilibrium after the change in the demand rotation ($E = E^{*})$, $MC^{*}$ should shift as in Figure \ref{fig:identification_example_step_3_1} and \ref{fig:identification_example_step_3_2}.
Note that we changed only the demand shifter, and hence the cost shifter $X^{s}$ is unchanged.
Thus, for observable equivalence to hold, $MC^{*}$ should also change along with the change in the demand rotation, which implies that $MC^{*}$ is a function of the demand shifter.
However, this is impossible because it violates Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}, that is, $MC^{*}$ should be a function of the quantity and the cost shifter only.
Therefore, even though the demand shifter is a scalar, when it works as a demand rotation instrument, observational equivalence does not holds for any $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, and hence the conduct parameter can be identified.


Note that in Definition \ref{definition:non_identification}, non-identification requires to find two distinct pairs of conduct parameter and marginal cost function that lead to the same equilibrium quantity.
Here, we showed only that the demand rotation breaks observable equivalence when $MC^{*}$ is a linear function, hence there is a possibility that under non-linear $MC$ and $MC^{*}$, observable equivalence can be achieved without depending on the demand shifter.
However, hereafter, we show that we cannot find any marginal cost function that leads to observable equivalence under the inverse demand \eqref{eq:demand_counterexample}.




\section{Characterization of Non-identification}\label{sec:nonidentification_characterization}

First, we characterizes the non-identification condition based on Definition \ref{definition:non_identification} by following the proof of necessary condition in \citet{lau1982identifying}, but with some modifications.
The characterization is based on the fact that observable equivalence implies that the reduced form of the equilibrium quantity $h_q$ and $h_q^{*}$ are identical for any $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$.
Therefore, its derivative with respect to the demand and cost shifters, $\nabla h_q$ and $\nabla h_q^{*}$, should be also identical.
Then, by applying the implicit function theorem to the equilibrium condition, we can compute $\nabla h_q$ and $\nabla h_q^{*}$, and hence we can derive the following proposition:
\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:nonidentification_charaterization}
    Non-identification implies that for any $X^{d}$, $X^{s}$, and $Q^e$ under these exogenous variables, we have for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$,
    \begin{align}
        &\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})\\  
        &= \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})\left[ \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) \right], \label{eq:nonidentification_demand}
    \end{align}
    and for $j = 1,\ldots, K_s$,
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}) = \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) \frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}),\label{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost}
    \end{align}
    where $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ is defined as
    \begin{align}
        \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) \equiv \frac{(1+\theta^{*})\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}. \label{eq:lambda_foc}
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}
See Appendix \ref{appendix:proof} for the detailed proof.
The modified part from \citet{lau1982identifying} is the definition of $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$.
While \citet{lau1982identifying} uses the same logic, he obtains the following equation slightly different from \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost}:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q, X^{s}) = \lambda'(Q, X^{s}) \frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q, X^{s}),\quad \forall Q, X^{s}, \label{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost_lau}
\end{align}
where $\lambda'(Q, X^{s})$ depends on $Q$ and $X^{s}$ but not $X^{d}$, and then he concludes that there is a transformation $T$ such that 
\begin{align}
    MC^{*}(Q, X^{s}) = T(MC(Q, X^{s}), Q). \label{eq:mc_transformation_lau}
\end{align}
The existence of the transformation $T$ is shown by integrating \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost_lau} with respect to $X^{s}$ when $X^{s}$ is a scalar, and by applying Lemma \ref{lemma_1_GU} from \citet{goldmanNote1964} when $X^{s}$ is a vector.

His argument has some problems.
First, when $\lambda(Q, X^{d}, X^{s})$ cannot be independent of $X^{d}$, and hence we cannot define $\lambda'(Q, X^{s})$.
This implies that  $MC^{*}$ recovered by \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_lau} needs to depend on $X^{d}$, which is not allowed as the marginal cost function should be independent of $X^{d}$ by Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}.
Second, neither $\lambda(Q, X^{d}, X^{s})$ nor $\lambda'(Q, X^{s})$ is a good tool to construct a transformation between $MC$ and $MC^{*}$ because they also consist of the derivative of $MC$ and $MC^{*}$.
Third, he uses only \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost} and does not use \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand}, and hence there could be the possibility that by fully using both equations, we can derive a new characterization of non-identification.





\subsection{Alternative Characterization of Non-identification}

To resolve these problems, we provide a new characterization of non-identification based on both \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} and \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost}.
First, for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$, we rewrite \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} as
\begin{align}
    &\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) }{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) }\\ 
    & \quad = \frac{(1+\theta^{*})\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}.
\end{align}
Note that Assumption \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium} guarantees that the right-hand side takes a finite value.
We also need to check that the left-hand side is well-defined, but temporarily we ignore this issue and
assume the left-hand side has a finite value (we will discuss this point in Lemma \ref{lemma:identification_condition_separable}).
Then, by rearranging this equation based on the derivative of $MC$ and $MC^{*}$ with respect to $Q$ at the equilibrium quantity, we have for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}) =D_i(Q^e, X^{d}) + C_i(Q^e, X^{d})\frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}),\label{eq:mc_transformation_quantity}
\end{align}
where $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ are defined as
\begin{align}
    C_i(Q, X^{d}) \equiv \frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) }{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) },\label{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    &D_i(Q, X^{d})\\
    &\equiv\frac{(\theta^{*} - \theta)\Bigg[\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) + Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q, X^{d})\right) \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) - Q \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_i\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) \Bigg]}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d})}.\label{eq:intercation_derivative_demand}
\end{align}

%This can be more simplified as (we suppress the arguments of the functions for brevity),
%\begin{align}
    %&(1+ \theta^{*})\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2} - \frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q} }{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q} }\left[(1+ \theta) \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}\right]\\
    %&= \frac{1}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}Q}\left[\left((1 + \theta^{*}) \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial  Q^2}\right)\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}\right)\right]\\
    %&\quad - \frac{1}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}Q}\left[\left( (1 + \theta) \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}\right)\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i} + \theta^{*} Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}\right)\right]\\
    %& = 
%\end{align}



Next, \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} and \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost} imply that for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ and $j = 1, \ldots, K_s$,
\begin{align}
    \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) =  \frac{\frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s})}{\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s})} =  \frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) }{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})},
\end{align}
and from the second equality, we have for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ and $j = 1, \ldots, K_s$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}) = C_i(Q^e, X^{d})\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_j}(Q^e, X^{s}).\label{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter}
\end{align}


Because \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} come from \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} and \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost}, they are also the necessary conditions for non-identification.
Note that \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} can be regarded as transformations of the derivative of $MC$ and $MC^{*}$ with respect to $Q$ and $X^{s}$ at the equilibrium quantity.
In other words, if we can find two different marginal cost functions $MC$ and $MC^{*}$ that leads to observable equivalence, $MC^{*}$ should be a transformation of $MC$.

An important note is that the right-hand sides of \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} include $C_i(Q^e, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q^e, X^{d})$, which are functions of $Q^e$ and $X^{d}$.
In contrast, the left-hand side of both equations does not depend on $Q^e$ and $X^{d}$, which implies that the transformation makes $MC^{*}$ depend on the demand shifter $X^{d}$.
However, this is not allowed by Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}, which reflects the intuition in Figure \ref{fig:identification_example}.
Therefore, to have a valid marginal cost function $MC^{*}$, $C_i$ and $D_i$ should be independent of $X^{d}$.



First, while Lau uses only \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost} which is the derivative with respect to $X^{s}$, this characterization uses the relationship between $MC$ and $MC^{*}$ with respect to both $Q$ and $X^{s}$.

Second, this characterization can restrict the form of the inverse demand function that leads to non-identification.
Note that \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} imply that given any conduct parameters $\theta$ and $\theta^{*}$, and a marginal cost function $MC$, marginal cost function $MC^{*}$ can be constructed based on \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter}.
However, \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} do not necessary leads to a valid marginal cost function because $C_i(Q^e, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q^e, X^{d})$ are functions of $Q^e$ and $X^{d}$.
Therefore, the left-hand side of \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} can be a function of $X^{d}$.
However, this violates the Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters} that $X^{d}$ is a vector of exclusive demand shifters.
Therefore, to have a valid marginal cost function $MC^{*}$, $C_i$ and $D_i$ should be independent of $X^{d}$.
Additionally, while we index $C_i$ and $D_i$ by $i$, the change in $X^{d}_i$ should not affect the change in $MC^{*}$.




To see characterizes the inverse demand function under which $C_i$ and $D_i$ are independent of $X^{d}$, we take the derivative of $C_i$ and $D_i$ with respect to $X^{d}$ and set it to zero.
To do this, we need the following assumption:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:three_times_differentiable}
    The inverse demand function is three times continuously differentiable.
    The marginal cost function is twice continuously differentiable.
\end{assumption}
This assumption puts a stronger restriction on the inverse demand function than Assumption \ref{assumption:twice_differentiable}.
However, this is necessary for the investigation because $C_i$ and $D_i$ already include second-order derivatives of the inverse demand function.
Another justification for this assumption is that recall that if we want to follow the argument in \citet{lau1982identifying} to construct a transformation between $MC$ and $MC^{*}$, we need to require that $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ is independent of $X^{d}$.
In this case, as $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ includes second-order derivatives of the inverse demand function, the three-times differentiability of the inverse demand function is also necessary for the investigation.

Of course, Proposition \ref{proposition:nonidentification_charaterization} requires twice-continuously differentiability.
To get a transformation $T$ between $MC$ and $MC^{*}$, Lemma \ref{lemma_1_GU} requires twice-continuously differentiability on the marginal cost functions.
However, because this way does not work, to move forward, it is not surprising that we need to assume three-times differentiability on the inverse demand function.

In fact, we have the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:identification_characterization}
    Given Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}, \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium}, and \ref{assumption:three_times_differentiable}, the conduct parameter $\theta$ cannot be identified from data on price, quantity, and other exogenous variables alone if and only if the industry inverse demand function is given as
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + k(Q), \label{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}
    \end{align}
    where $\alpha_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ is a constant but not $\alpha_1 = -\frac{1}{\theta}$, and $h(\cdot)$ and $k(\cdot)$ are twice continuously differentiable functions.
\end{theorem}
Note that \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand} is a separable function.
However, our theorem tells more about under what type of separable function the non-identification holds.
Observe that when $\alpha_1 \ne 0$, the demand shifter changes only the slope of the inverse demand function, but not the intercept, and when $\alpha_1 = 0$, the demand shifter changes only the intercept of the inverse demand function, but not the slope.
Therefore, we cannot have any demand shifter that works as a demand rotation instrument under \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}, and hence the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function are not identified.

This result connects to the idea of \citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} that demand rotation instrument is a key to identify the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function even in more general settings.
Additionally, in contrast to Theorem \ref{theorem_lau}, this result implies that there are inverse demand functions under which the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function are identified when the demand shifter is a scalar.



\subsubsection{Necessary Condition for Non-identification}


So far, we have implicitly assumed that $C_i$ and $D_i$ have finite values.
However, this is not always the case because the denominator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} can be zero and hence $C_i$ and $D_i$ take infinite values.
When this happens, \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} and \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_cost_shifter} are not satisfied, which implies that the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function are identified.
In fact, the condition that the denominator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} is not zero restricts the class of inverse demand functions that always leads to identification.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:identification_condition_separable}
    When $\theta \ne 0$, $C_i$ and $D_i$ are not well-defined because the denominator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} is zero, that is, 
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) = 0. \label{eq:identification_condition_separable}
    \end{align}
    Therefore, under this inverse demand function, the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function are identified.
    Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the set of demand shifters where \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} holds.
    Then, \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} leads to the inverse demand function such that
    \begin{align}
        P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}h(X^{d}) + k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}), \label{eq:identification_separable_demand}
    \end{align}
    where $X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}$ is the vector of demand shifters whose index is not in $\mathcal{I}$.
    The numerator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} is always nonzero under \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand}.
\end{lemma}
See Appendix \ref{appendix:proof} for the proof.
Note that \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial X^{d}_i}\left( P(Q, X^{d}) + \theta Q \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d})\right) = 0,
\end{align}
which is the derivative of the marginal revenue under $\theta$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$.
Thus, \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} implies that the marginal revenue is not affected by $X^{d}_i$.
Additionally, the equilibrium condition \eqref{eq:foc_alpha} becomes
\begin{align}
    k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) + \theta Qk'(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) = MC(Q, X^{s}),
\end{align}
which implies that the equilibrium quantity is not affected by the change in $X^{d}_i$.
Therefore, under \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand}, all demand shifters whose index is in $\mathcal{I}$ work as a demand rotation instrument when the conduct parameter is $\theta$.
On the other hands, for any other conduct parameter $\theta^{*}$, the marginal revenue is always affected by $X^{d}_i$.
Therefore, the observable equivalence is always violated.







Now, given that \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} does not hold, we characterize the class of inverse demand functions that makes $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ independent of $X^{d}$.
\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:nonidentification_inverse_demand}
    Non-identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function implies that $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ are independent of $X^{d}$ and \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} does not hold for any $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$.
    This holds if and only if the inverse demand function is given as \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}.
\end{proposition}
See Appendix \ref{appendix:proof} for the proof.

\begin{example}\label{example:linear_demand}
    The inverse demand \eqref{eq:demand_counterexample} does not satisfy \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}, and the transformation \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} is given as
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s}) = (\theta^{*} - \theta)(-\alpha_1 + \alpha_3X^{d}) +  \frac{\alpha_2 + \theta\alpha_3Q}{\alpha_2 + \theta^{*}\alpha_3Q}\frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s}).
    \end{align}
    This implies that any new marginal cost function $MC^{*}$ that is observationally equivalent to the given marginal cost function $MC$ should depend on the demand shifter.
    Figure \ref{fig:identification_example} considers the case with linear marginal cost function, but this intuition holds for any marginal cost function $MC$.
\end{example}


\subsubsection{Sufficient Condition for Non-identification}

Now, we move to the sufficient condition.
Suppose that we have a transformation $T$ of the marginal revenue and the marginal cost under $(\theta, MC)$ and $(\theta^{*}, MC^{*})$:
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) = T\left(P(Q, X^{d}) + \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}), Q\right)
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    MC(Q, X^{s}) = T\left(MC(Q, X^{s}), Q\right).
\end{align}
Then, when an equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ satisfies the equilibrium condition under $(\theta, MC)$, $Q^e$ also satisfies the equilibrium condition under $(\theta^{*}, MC^{*})$ because by using the transformation, we have that
\begin{align}
    T\left(P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}), Q^e\right)&= T\left(MC(Q^e, X^{s}), Q^e\right)\\
    P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})&= MC^{*}(Q^e, X^{s}).
\end{align}
This implies that given a conduct parameter $\theta$ and a marginal cost function $MC$, for any conduct parameter $\theta^{*}$, we can construct a new marginal cost function $MC^{*}$ and transform the marginal revenue under $\theta$ to the marginal revenue under $\theta^{*}$ so that observable equivalence holds between $(\theta, MC)$ and $(\theta^{*}, MC^{*})$.
Therefore, we are interested in whether \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand} can lead to such a transformation.
In fact, \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} can give us the transformation under \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}, which implies that the inverse demand function \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand} can lead to non-identification.
We state this result as a proposition and the proof is given in Appendix \ref{appendix:proof}:
\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:sufficient_nonidentification}
    The inverse demand function \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand} where $\alpha_1 \ne -\frac{1}{\theta}$ is a sufficient condition for non-identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function.
\end{proposition}


\begin{remark}
    \citet{lau1982identifying}'s sufficiency proof is incomplete because it implicitly assumes that there exists a transformation $T$ under a separable inverse demand function whose function form is \eqref{eq:separable_demand}.
    Proposition \ref{proposition:sufficient_nonidentification} shows that more specific separable inverse demand function can lead to a transformation that leads to non-identification.

\section{Omitted Proofs}\label{appendix:proof}
In this section, we provide the proofs of the lemmas and theorems in the main text.
In what follows, we suppress the arguments of functions when no confusion arises.


\subsection{Proof of Proposition \ref{proposition:nonidentification_charaterization}}
Assume that given $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, we can solve the equilibrium condition for the equilibrium quantity $Q^e$.
For notational simplicity, we define
\begin{align}
    F(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) \equiv P(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) - MC(Q^e, X^{s}).
\end{align}
Then, by Assumption \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium}, we can apply the implicit function theorem, and for the reduced-form equation $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$, the gradient of the reduced-form function $h_q$ with respect to $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \nabla h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) =  \left( -\dfrac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{m}_{i}}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})} \right)_{\substack{m = d, s\\ i = 1, \ldots, K_m}}. \label{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply}
\end{align}
The derivatives of $F$ for each variable are
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) & =  \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})Q^e, \quad i = 1, \ldots, K_d,\\
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) & =  -\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{s}), \quad i = 1, \ldots, K_s, \\
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) & = (1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}).
\end{align}
Thus, the derivative of $h$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$ and $X^{s}_i$ are given as for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ and $i = 1, \ldots, K_s$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(X^{d}, X^{s}) = -\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) }{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta  Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}, \label{eq:foc_derivative_demand}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{s}_{i}}(X^{d}, X^{s}) & = \frac{\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{s})}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta  Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}. \label{eq:foc_derivative_supply}
\end{align}

% Use the definition of non-identification
Note that the same argument can be applied to the equilibrium condition \eqref{eq:foc_beta} of the alternative model.
Recall that the non-identification implies that $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) = h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s})$ for all $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, and hence we must have
\begin{align}
    \nabla h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s}) = \nabla h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) \quad \forall X^{d}, X^{s}. \label{eq:observale_equivalence_derivative}
\end{align}
From \eqref{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply}, this implies that for all $Q^e$, $X^{d}$, and $X^{s}$,
\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{K_d}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{K_s}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{K_d}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{K_s}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)
    \end{pmatrix},\label{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply_lambda}
\end{align}
where $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ is defined as
\begin{align}
    \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) \equiv \frac{(1+\theta^{*})\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*} Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta Q^e\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}) - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}.
\end{align}
Assumption \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium} guarantees that $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ is nonzero and finite.
From the first $K_d$ rows in \eqref{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply_lambda}, \eqref{eq:nonidentification_demand} and for the later $K_s$ rows, \eqref{eq:nonidentification_marginal_cost} hold.





\subsection{Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma:identification_condition_separable}}
Note that when $\theta = 0$, \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} implies that $\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = 0$ for any $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$.
This cannot be held because it violates Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}.
Therefore, we assume that $\theta \ne 0$.
Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the set of the indices of the elements in $X^{d}$ that satisfy \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable}.

For all $i \in \mathcal{I}$, from \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable}, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial Q}\log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = -\frac{1}{\theta Q}.
\end{align}
By integrating both sides with respect to $Q$, we have
\begin{align}
    \log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = -\frac{1}{\theta}\log Q + H_i(X^{d}),
\end{align}
where $H_i(X^{d})$ is a function of $X^{d}$.
By taking the exponential of both sides, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = h_i(X^{d})Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}},
\end{align}
where $h_i(X^{d})  = \exp(H_i(X^{d}))$.
Note that this is a derivative of $P$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$ and is a separable function of $Q$ and $X^{d}$, 
it is natural to think that $h_i(X^{d})$ is a derivative of a function of $X^{d}$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$.
In other words, there is a function $h(X^{d})$ of $X^{d}$ such that $h_i(X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i}$ holds.
Therefore, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i} Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}.
\end{align}

By integrating both sides with respect to $X^{d}_i$, we have
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}h(X^{d}) + k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i}), \quad i \in \mathcal{I}, \label{eq:identification_separable_demand_i}
\end{align}
where $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is a function of $Q$ and $X^{d}_{-i}$ and $X^{d}_{-i}$ is the vector of $X^{d}$ excluding $X^{d}_i$.
When $X^{d}$ is a scalar, there is no argument in $X^{d}_{-i}$, and hence we can remove the index of $i$.
Therefore, $k(Q, X^{d}_{-i}) = k(Q)$ holds, and hence we have \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand}.

When $X^{d}$ is a vector and $|\mathcal{I}| = 1$, we can remove the index of $i$ for notational simplicity.
If $|\mathcal{I}| > 1$, we can remove the index of $k_i$ in the following way.
Pick up any $i$ and $j$ in $\mathcal{I}$ such that $i \ne j$, and then the derivative of \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand_i} with respect to $X^{d}_j$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_j}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_j} Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}} + \frac{\partial k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})}{\partial X^{d}_j},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_j}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_j} Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}.
\end{align}
Therefore, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})}{\partial X^{d}_j} = 0,
\end{align} 
which implies that $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is independent of $X^{d}_j$.
By applying the same argument to all $i \in \mathcal{I}$, we can show that $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is independent of the demand shifters whose indices are in $\mathcal{I}$.
Let $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}})$ be the resulting function where $X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}$ is the vector of $X^{d}$ excluding the elements whose indices are in $\mathcal{I}$.
Then, by comparing \eqref{eq:identification_separable_demand_i} for all $i \in \mathcal{I}$, we have
\begin{align}
    k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) = k_j(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) \quad \forall i,j \in \mathcal{I},
\end{align}
which implies that $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) = k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}})$ for all $i \in \mathcal{I}$.
Therefore, we have that
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}h(X^{d}) + k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}).
\end{align}
Note that when $|\mathcal{I}| = 1$, $X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}} = X^{d}_{-i}$, and hence the demand function can keep consistency with the case when $|\mathcal{I}| = 1$.


Next, we check whether the numerator of \eqref{eq:ratio_marginal_revenue} is nonzero.
By substituting the above inverse demand function into the numerator, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d}) + \theta^{*}\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q, X^{d})Q  &= Q^{-1/\theta} h_i(X^d) - \frac{\theta^{*}}{\theta^{*}} Q^{-1/\theta-1} h_i(X^d) Q\\
    &= Q^{-1/\theta} h_i(X^d) \left(1 - \frac{\theta}{\theta^{*}} \right).
\end{align}
By Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters}, we have $h_i(X^d) \ne 0$.
Therefore, as $\theta \ne \theta^{*}$, the numerator is nonzero, which implies that $C_i = \infty$.


\subsection{Proof of Proposition \ref{proposition:nonidentification_inverse_demand}}


Because $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ should be independent of $X^{d}$ simultaneously, we can first characterize the class of inverse demand functions that make $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ independent of $X^{d}$.
Then, we characterize the class of inverse demand functions that make $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ independent of $X^{d}$ by substituting the derived inverse demand function into $D_i(Q, X^{d})$.

\subsubsection*{Step 1: Necessity for $C_i$ is independent of $X^{d}$}
When $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ is independent of $X^{d}$, the derivative of $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ with respect to $X^{d}$ is zero.
Let $u_i(Q, X^{d}) \equiv \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})$.
Then, the derivative of $C_i$ with respect to $X^{d}_j$ for $j = 1, \ldots, K_d$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial X^{d}_j}(Q, X^{d}) & = \frac{(\theta^{*} - \theta)Q }{\left(u_i + \theta Q \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial Q}\right)^2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j\partial Q} u_i - \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial Q} \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j}\right).
\end{align}
Note that because \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} does not hold, the denominator is not zero.
Therefore, the derivative becomes zero if and only if
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j\partial Q} u_i - \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial Q} \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j} = 0.
\end{align}
Note that 
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial^2 \log u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j \partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) & = \frac{\partial }{\partial Q}\left(\frac{1}{u_i}\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j}\right) = \frac{1}{u_i^2}\left(u_i\frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j \partial Q} - \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X^{d}_j}\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial Q}\right).
\end{align}
Because Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters} guarantees that $u_i \ne 0$, it is sufficient to solve the partial differential equation, for any $i,j = 1, \ldots, K_d$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial X^{d}_j \partial Q}\log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = 0.
\end{align}
This implies that $\frac{\partial }{\partial Q}\log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right)$ is independent of any element in $X^{d}$, and hence
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial Q}\log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = G(Q).
\end{align}

By integrating both sides with respect to $Q$, we have for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$,
\begin{align}
    \log \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d})\right) = \int G(Q) dQ + H_i(X^{d}).
\end{align}
As for the last term, by taking the integral by $Q$, we must have an arbitrary function of $X^{d}$ as an analogue of the constant of integration as $P$ is a function of $Q$ and $X^{d}$.
By taking exponential both side, we have for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \exp(H_i(X^{d})) \exp\left(\int G(Q) dQ\right) \equiv h_i(X^{d}) g(Q).
\end{align}
Because this derivative is a separable function of $Q$ and $X^{d}$, it is natural to think that $h_i(X^{d})$ is a derivative of a function of $X^{d}$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$.
In other words, there is a function $h(X^{d})$ of $X^{d}$ such that $h_i(X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i}$ holds.
Therefore, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i} g(Q).
\end{align}

By taking the integration with respect to $X^{d}_i$ on both sides, we have
\begin{align}
   P(Q, X^{d}) = g(Q) h(X^{d}) + k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i}), \quad i = 1, \ldots, K_d, \label{eq:inverse_demand_separable_step1}
\end{align}
where $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is an arbitrary function of $Q$ and $X^{d}_{-i}$ and $X^{d}_{-i}$ is the vector of $X^{d}$ excluding $X^{d}_i$.
When $X^{d}$ is a scalar, there is no argument in $X^{d}_{-i}$, and hence we can remove the index of $i$, that is, $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i}) = k(Q)$.
When $X^{d}$ is a vector, we can remove the index of $k_i$ in the following way.
Pick up an $i$, and then the derivative of \eqref{eq:inverse_demand_separable_step1} with respect to $X^{d}_i$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i} g(Q),
\end{align}
and for any other $j \ne i$, the same derivative is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{\partial h(X^{d})}{\partial X^{d}_i} g(Q) + \frac{\partial k_j(Q, X^{d}_{-j})}{\partial X^{d}_i}.
\end{align}
This implies that
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial k_j(Q, X^{d}_{-j})}{\partial X^{d}_i} = 0 \quad \text{for all } j \ne i.
\end{align}
Therefore, $k_j(Q, X^{d}_{-j})$ is independent of $X^{d}_i$, and hence $k_j$ is independent of $X^{d}_j$ and $X^{d}_i$.
By applying the same argument to all $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$, we can show that $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i})$ is independent of $X^{d}_{-i}$, that is, $k_i(Q, X^{d}_{-i}) = k_i(Q)$.
By comparing \eqref{eq:inverse_demand_separable_step1} for all $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$, it is easy to see that $k_i(Q) = k_j(Q)$ for any $i,j = 1, \ldots, K_d$, that is, we have a function $k(Q)$ such that $k_i(Q) = k(Q)$.
Therefore, $P(Q, X^{d})$ must be of the form
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = h(X^{d})g(Q) + k(Q).
\end{align}


\subsubsection*{Step 2: Necessity for $D_i$ is independent of $X^{d}$}
Next, given the inverse demand function, we further specify the form of the inverse demand function based on $D_i(Q, X^{d})$.
By substituting the inverse demand function into $D_i(Q, X^{d})$, we have
\begin{align}
    D_i(Q, X^{d}) = &\frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{h_i(X^{d})(g(Q) + \theta Q g'(Q))}\Bigg[
    (g'(Q)h_i(X^{d}) + k'(Q) )g(Q)h_i'(X^{d})\\
    & \hspace{4.5cm} + Q(g''(Q)h_i(X^{d}) + k''(Q))g(Q)h_i(X^{d}) \\
    &\hspace{5cm} - Q(g'(Q)h(X^{d}) + k'(Q))g'(Q)h_i(X^{d})\Bigg]\\
    =&  \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{g(Q) + \theta Q g'(Q)}\Bigg[h(X^{d})(g'(Q)g(Q) + Qg{''}(Q)g(Q) - Q (g'(Q))^{2})\\
    & \hspace{4.5cm} + k'(Q)g(Q) + Qk''(Q)g(Q) - Qk'(Q)g'(Q)\Bigg].
\end{align}
The dependence of $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ on $X^{d}$ comes only from the first term in the bracket.
Therefore, $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ is independent of $X^{d}$ if and only if
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial h}{\partial X^{d}_i}(X^{d})(g'(Q)g(Q) + Qg{''}(Q)g(Q) - Q (g'(Q))^{2}) = 0.
\end{align}
However, Assumption \ref{assumption:exclusive_shifters} implies that the derivative of $h(X^{d})$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$ is nonzero.
Therefore, we must have 
\begin{align}
    g'(Q)g(Q) + Qg{''}(Q)g(Q) - Q (g'(Q))^{2} = 0.
\end{align}
Let $v(Q) = \frac{g'(Q)}{g(Q)}$.
Because $v'(Q) = \frac{g''(Q)g(Q) - (g'(Q))^2}{g(Q)^2}$, we have
\begin{align}
    v(Q) + Qv'(Q) = 0.
\end{align}
This is a first-order linear differential equation.
Then, 
\begin{align}
    \frac{d }{d Q}\log v(Q) = -\frac{1}{Q}.
\end{align}
Integrating both sides with respect to $Q$, we have
\begin{align}
    \log v(Q) = -\log Q + a_1,
\end{align}
where $a_1$ is a constant.
By taking the exponential of both sides, we have
\begin{align}
    v(Q) = \frac{\alpha_1}{Q}, 
\end{align}
where $\alpha_1 = \exp(a_1)$.
By using the definition of $v(Q)$, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{d }{d Q}\log g(Q) = \alpha_1\frac{d}{dQ}\log Q.
\end{align}
Again, by integrating both sides with respect to $Q$, we have
\begin{align}
    \log g(Q) = \alpha_1\log Q + a_2,
\end{align}
where $a_2$ is a constant.
By taking the exponential of both sides, we have
\begin{align}
    g(Q) = \alpha_2Q^{\alpha_1},
\end{align}
where $\alpha_2 = \exp(a_2)$.
In summary, when $C_i$ and $D_i$ are independent of $X^{d}$, the inverse demand function must be of the form
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + k(Q). \label{eq:inverse_demand_separable_step2}
\end{align}
Here, we absorb $\alpha_2$ into $h(\cdot)$.


Recall that we require that \eqref{eq:identification_condition_separable} does not hold for any $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$.
In Lemma \ref{lemma:identification_condition_separable}, the choice of $k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}})$ is arbitrary, we can set $k(Q, X^{d}_{-\mathcal{I}}) = k(Q)$ without loss of generality.
Then, by comparing this inverse demand function with \eqref{eq:inverse_demand_separable_step2}, it is easy to see that the conduct parameter is identified when $\alpha_1 = -\frac{1}{\theta}$.
Therefore, we need to assume that $\alpha_1 \ne -\frac{1}{\theta}$ to ensure the non-identification of the conduct parameter.



\subsubsection*{Step 3: Sufficiency}
Now, we show that $C_i$ and $D_i$ are independent of $X^{d}$ under the inverse demand function.
Under the inverse demand function \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}, $C_i(Q, X^{d})$ and $D_i(Q, X^{d})$ are given by
\begin{align}
    C_i(Q, X^{d}) = \frac{Q^{\alpha_1}h'(X^{d}) + \theta^{*}\alpha_1Q^{\alpha_1}h'(X^{d})}{Q^{\alpha_1}h'(X^{d}) + \theta \alpha_1 Q^{\alpha_1}h'(X^{d})} = \frac{1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1}{1 + \theta\alpha_1}.
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    D_i(Q, X^{d}) & = \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{Q^{\alpha_1} + \theta \alpha_1Q^{\alpha_1}} \left[ k'(Q)Q^{\alpha_1} + Qk''(Q) Q^{\alpha_1} - k'(Q)\alpha_1Q^{\alpha_1} \right]\\
    &= \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \left[\frac{d}{dQ}Qk'(Q)  -\alpha_1k'(Q) \right].
\end{align}
Thus, $C_i$ and $D_i$ are independent of $X^{d}$ under the inverse demand function, which implies that the inverse demand function is the necessary and sufficient condition for $C_i$ and $D_i$ to be independent of $X^{d}$.



\subsection{Proof of Proposition \ref{proposition:sufficient_nonidentification}}

From the proof of Proposition \ref{proposition:nonidentification_inverse_demand}, we know that $C_i$ and $D_i$ to be independent of $X^{d}$ under \eqref{eq:nonidentification_inverse_demand}.
Then, consider a transformation of the derivative of a function $f(Q, X)$ with respect to $Q$ based on \eqref{eq:mc_transformation_quantity} such that
\begin{align}
    T_Q\left(f(Q,X), Q\right) \equiv \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{1 + \theta\alpha_1}\left[\frac{d}{dQ}Qk'(Q)  -\alpha_1k'(Q) \right]+ \frac{1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial Q}(Q, X).
\end{align}
This can be integrated with respect to $Q$, and hence we obtain a transformation of $f(Q, X)$ as
\begin{align}
    T\left(f(Q,X), Q\right) \equiv \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \left[Qk'(Q) - \alpha_1k(Q) \right] + \frac{1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} f(Q, X).
\end{align}

First, by substituting a marginal cost $MC$ into $T$, we can obtain a new marginal cost $MC^{*}$.
Second, by substituting the marginal revenue under $\theta$ into $T$, we have
\begin{align}
    & \frac{\theta^{*} - \theta}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \left[Qk'(Q) - \alpha_1k(Q) \right] + \frac{1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1}{1 + \theta\alpha_1} \left[(1+\theta\alpha_1) Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + k(Q) + \theta Qk'(Q)\right]\\
    = & (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1)Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + \frac{(\theta^{*} - \theta + (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1)\theta)Qk'(Q) + (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1 - (\theta^{*} - \theta)\alpha_1) k(Q)}{1 + \theta\alpha_1}\\
    = & (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1)Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) + \frac{(1 + \theta\alpha_1) k(Q) + \theta^{*}(1 + \theta\alpha_1)Qk'(Q) }{1 + \theta\alpha_1}\\
    = & (1 + \theta^{*}\alpha_1)Q^{\alpha_1}h(X^{d}) +k(Q) + \theta^{*}Qk'(Q),
\end{align}
where the last line is the marginal revenue under $\theta^{*}$.
Therefore, under the inverse demand function, $T$ can connect the marginal revenue under the two models.
As the result, $T$ can connect the equilibrium conditions under the two models, which implies that the inverse demand function is a sufficient condition for the non-identification.



\section{Summary of Goldman and Uzawa (1964)}\label{appendix:summary_goldman_uzawa}

Let $n$ be the number of variables and $x = (x_{1},\ldots, x_{n})$ be a vector of $n$ variables.
Consider a partition of $X$ into $K$ parts, $\{x^1, \ldots, x^K\}$ such that $X = \bigcup_{k=1}^K x^k$ and $x^k \cap x^l = \emptyset$ for $k\ne l$.
\begin{definition}\label{def:weal_separable}
    A function is weakly separable with respect to the partition if 
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x_l}\left(\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x^1, \ldots, x^K)}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x^1, \ldots, x^K)}\right) = 0, \quad i,j\in x^k, l \notin x^k.
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
This implies that the ratio of the derivative with respect to $x_i$ and $x_j$, which are in the same category, is not affected by the change in the variables in other partitions.
Intuitively, by taking the ratio, the component of $f$ relating to $x_l$ is canceled out, and hence the derivative of the ratio with respect to $x_l$ becomes zero.
When $f$ is a utility function, this implies that the marginal rate of substitution between commodity $i$ and $j$ in the same partition is independent of the quantities of commodities outside $x^k$.

Then, \citet{goldmanNote1964} specifies the functional form that a weak separable function should satisfy.
\begin{theorem}\label{thorem_2_GU}
    A function $f(x)$ is weakly separable with respect to a partition $\{x^1, .. ., x^K\}$ if and only if $f(x)$ is of the form: 
    \begin{align}
        f(X) = \Phi(r^1(x^{1}),\ldots, r^K(x^{K})   )
    \end{align} where $\Phi(r^1,\ldots, r^K)$ is a function of $K$ variables and, for each $k$, $r^k(x^{k})$ is a function subvector $x^{k}$ alone.
\end{theorem}

The next lemma is a key lemma in the proof of \citet{lau1982identifying}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma_1_GU}
    Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be two continuously twice-differentiable functions of $n$ variables $x=(x_1, \dots, x_n)$. If each indifference surface is connected, and if there exists a function $\lambda(x)$ such that
    \begin{align}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x) &= \lambda(x)\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x), \quad i=1, \dots, n, \quad \text{for all } x, \label{eq:transform_f}
    \end{align}
    then $f(x)$ is a transformation of $g(x)$; namely, there exists a function $T(\cdot)$ of one variable such that
    \begin{align}
    f(x) &= T(g(x)) \quad \text{for all } x.
    \end{align}
    Hence, in particular, the function $\lambda(x)$ satisfying \eqref{eq:transform_f} must be of the form:
    \begin{align}
        \lambda(x) &= \Lambda(g(x)) \quad \text{for all } x, \label{eq:form_of_lambda}
    \end{align}
    with some function $\Lambda(\cdot)$ of one variable.
\end{lemma}
If there is a function $T$ such that $f(x) = T(g(x))$, then by the chain rule, we have $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x) = T'(g(x))\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x)$ where $T'$ is the derivative of $T$.
Thus, by defining $\lambda(x) = T'(g(x))$, we have $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x) = \lambda(x)\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x)$.
Intuitively, the lemma implies that the converse of the chain rule holds under additional conditions.
