    In this note, we revisit the identification result of conduct parameters in homogeneous goods markets by \citet{lau1982identifying}.
    The result is that the conduct parameter cannot be identified if and only if the demand function is separable but not a specific functional form.
    We show that the result is incorrect by providing a separable demand function that induces identification.
    This implies that the class of inverse demand functions that lead to identification is broader than \citet{lau1982identifying} considers.
    Therefore, when the market has enough variation, the conduct parameter can be identified in the broader class of inverse demand functions.

\section{Introduction}
Measuring competitiveness is an important task in the empirical industrial organization literature.
The conduct parameter approach is one of the useful approaches to measure competitiveness.
However, the parameter cannot be directly measured from data because data generally lack information about marginal costs.
Therefore, researchers endeavor to identify and estimate conduct parameters.

In homogeneous goods markets, \cite{bresnahan1982oligopoly} considers the identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function in linear demand and linear marginal cost model.
\citet{bresnahan1982oligopoly} finds that when the researcher can obtain a demand shifter, called a demand rotation instrument, that changes the slope and intercept of the inverse demand function, the conduct parameter and the marginal cost parameter can be identified.
Recently, \citet{matsumura2023resolving} provide a detailed condition for the identification.
\citet{lau1982identifying} considers a more general setting and shows that the conduct parameter is not identified if and only if the demand function is separable, except a specific functional form.

However, we show that the identification result in \citet{lau1982identifying} is incorrect by providing a counterexample where a separable demand function induces identification.
While the proof of \citet{lau1982identifying} is incorrect, we don't need to worry because the counterexample shows that the class of inverse demand functions that lead to identification is broader than the class considered in \citet{lau1982identifying}.
Thus, when the market has enough variation, the conduct parameter can be identified in a broader class of inverse demand functions.


\section{Model}
Consider a homogeneous product market with the aggregate inverse demand and aggregate marginal cost function as $P(Q, X^{d})$ and $MC(Q, X^{s})$ where $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ are the vector of exogenous variables.
Assume that $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ are exclusive; that is, there is no common variable in $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$.
Thus, $X^{d}$ works as demand shifters, and $X^{s}$ works as cost shifters. 
Let $K_d$ and $K_s$ be the number of demand shifters and cost shifters, respectively.
We define the following function $F(Q, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)$ as
\begin{align}
    F(Q, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) \equiv P(Q, X^{d}) + \theta \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{d}) Q - MC(Q, X^{s}),
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is called the conduct parameter. 
The equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ is characterized by the first-order condition,
\begin{align}
    F(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) = 0.
\end{align}
Depending on the value of $\theta$, the relation can nest the first-order condition of several models, such as perfect competition ($\theta=0$) and Cournot competition ($\theta=1/N$).

\citet{lau1982identifying} impose the following restriction on the inverse demand and the marginal cost function:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:twice_differentiable}
    The inverse demand and the marginal cost function are twice continuously differentiable.
\end{assumption}

\citet{lau1982identifying} does not impose any further restrictions except Assumption \ref{assumption:twice_differentiable}, but we are interested in the point identification of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function, and hence it is natural to assume that the equilibrium quantity exists and is unique, which needs the following additional assumption:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:unique_equilibrium}
    Given an inverse demand function, a conduct parameter, and a marginal cost function, and given $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$,
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(Q^{e}, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) \ne 0 \text{ and } \left| \frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(Q^{e}, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\right| < \infty. 
    \end{align}
\end{assumption}


Suppose that the researcher observes the aggregate price $P$ and the aggregate quantity $Q$, and the vector of exogenous variables $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$.
Then, \citet{lau1982identifying} considers the identification problem of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function.
Based on the exogenous variables, the researcher can identify the reduced form of the equilibrium quantity $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$.
Given the inverse demand function, the reduced form of the equilibrium price is $P$, defined as $h_p(X^{d}, X^{s})$, is also identified.
We put this fact as an assumption:
\begin{assumption}\label{assumption:reduced_form_identification}
    The reduced form of the equilibrium quantity $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$ and the reduced form of the equilibrium price $P^e = h_p(X^{d}, X^{s})$ are identified from the data on price, quantity, and other exogenous variables.
\end{assumption}









\citet{lau1982identifying} takes an indirect approach and specifies the conditions under which the model is not identified.
The definition of non-identification is as follows:
\begin{definition}\label{def:non_identification}
Non-identification implies for any $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$,
\begin{align}
& F(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) = 0,  \label{eq:foc_alpha}\\
& F(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*}) = 0,\label{eq:foc_beta}
\end{align}
where $\theta \neq \theta^{*}$, $MC \ne MC^{*}$, and the equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ has a reduced form functions $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$ and $Q^e = h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s})$ defined by \eqref{eq:foc_alpha} and \eqref{eq:foc_beta} respectively are identical.
\end{definition}

In other words, given two distinct pairs of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost, the equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ solves the first-order condition for both pairs.
Non-identification asks the following question: given an identified inverse demand function, is it possible to find two distinct pairs of a conduct parameter and a marginal cost that lead to observable equivalent equilibrium?
Then, \citet{lau1982identifying} finds that the separability of the inverse demand function and non-identification are equivalent.
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem_lau}
    Given Assumption \ref{assumption:twice_differentiable} and Assumption \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium},
    the conduct parameter $\theta$ cannot be identified from data on price, quantity, and other exogenous variables alone if and only if the industry inverse demand function is separable in $X^{d}$, that is,
    \begin{align}
        p = P(Q, r(X^{d})), \label{eq:demand_separable}
    \end{align}
    but not take the form, 
    \begin{align}
        P = Q^{-1/\theta}r(X^{d}) + s(Q). \label{eq:identification_separable}
    \end{align}
\end{theorem}
The theorem implies that the conduct parameter is identified when the demand function is not separable or is separable but given by \eqref{eq:identification_separable}.\footnote{The separable inverse demand \eqref{eq:demand_separable} has weak separability defined in \citet{goldmanNote1964}. For example, when the inverse demand function include a demand rotation instrument, the inverse demand function becomes non-separable.}Additionally, the function $r(X^{d})$ is as a single variable depending on $X^{d}$.
Thus, the theorem also implies that when the demand shifter is a scalar, except \eqref{eq:identification_separable}, the conduct parameter cannot identified.



\section{Counterexample to the sufficiency of separability}\label{sec:counterexample_sufficiency}
In this section, we show that the sufficiency does not hold; that is, the separable inverse demand function does not imply the non-identification of the conduct parameter.
Before proving the counterexample, we provide a lemma that characterizes the non-identification.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:non-identification_transformation}
    Non-identification implies that there exists a function $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ such that
    \begin{align}
        &\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*}\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})Q^e \\
        &\quad = \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) \left[\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})Q^e \right] \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, K_d,\label{eq:lambda_foc_demand}
    \end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume that given $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, we can solve the first-order condition for the equilibrium quantity $Q^e$.
Then, by Assumption \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium}, we can apply the implicit function theorem, and for the reduced-form equation $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s})$, the derivative of $h$ with respect to the demand shifters and the cost shifters are
\begin{align}
    Dh_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) = \begin{pmatrix}
        \dfrac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{d}_{1}}(X^{d}, X^{s})\\
        \vdots \\
        \dfrac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{d}_{K_d}}(X^{d}, X^{s})\\[1em]
        \dfrac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{s}_{1}}(X^{d}, X^{s})\\
        \vdots \\
        \dfrac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{s}_{K_s}}(X^{d}, X^{s})
    \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
        -\dfrac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{1}}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}\\
        \vdots \\
        -\dfrac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{K_d}}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}\\[1.5em]
        -\dfrac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{1}}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}\\
        \vdots \\        
        -\dfrac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}), X^{d}, X^{s})}
    \end{pmatrix}.\label{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply}
\end{align}
The derivatives of $F$ for each variable are
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) & =  \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})Q^e, \quad i = 1, \ldots, K_d,\\
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) & =  -\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{s}), \quad i = 1, \ldots, K_s, \\
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC) & = (1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d})Q^e - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}).
\end{align}
Thus, the derivative of $h$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$ and $X^{s}_i$ are given as for $i = 1, \ldots, K_d$ and $i = 1, \ldots, K_s$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(X^{d}, X^{s}) = -\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d}_i) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}_i)Q^e }{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}_i) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}_i)Q^e - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}, \label{eq:foc_derivative_demand}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial h_q}{\partial X^{s}_{i}}(X^{d}, X^{s}) & = \frac{\frac{\partial MC}{\partial X^{s}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{s}_i)}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}_i) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d}_i)Q^e - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s}_i)}. \label{eq:foc_derivative_supply}
\end{align}

% Use the definition of non-identification
Note that the same argument can be applied to the first-order condition \eqref{eq:foc_beta} of the alternative model.
Recall that the non-identification implies that $Q^e = h_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) = h_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s})$ for all $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$, and hence we must have
\begin{align}
    Dh_q^{*}(X^{d}, X^{s}) = Dh_q(X^{d}, X^{s}) \quad \forall X^{d}, X^{s}. \label{eq:observale_equivalence_derivative}
\end{align}
From \eqref{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply}, this implies that for all $Q^e$, $X^{d}$, and $X^{s}$,
\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{K_d}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{K_s}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta^{*}, MC^{*})
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{d}_{K_d}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{1}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)\\
        \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial X^{s}_{K_s}}(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}; \theta, MC)
    \end{pmatrix},\label{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply_lambda}
\end{align}
where $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ is defined as
\begin{align}
    \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) \equiv \frac{(1+\theta^{*})\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta^{*}\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d})Q^e - \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}{(1+\theta)\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d}) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial Q^2}(Q^e, X^{d})Q^e - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{s})}. \label{eq:lambda_foc}
\end{align}
Assumption \ref{assumption:unique_equilibrium} guarantees that $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})$ is well-defined and $\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}) \ne 0$ and $|\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})| < \infty$.
Therefore, it is easy to see from \eqref{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply_lambda} that the first $K_d$ rows in \eqref{eq:foc_derivative_demand_supply_lambda} are equivalent to \eqref{eq:lambda_foc_demand}.
\end{proof}



\begin{align}
    \frac{-c+dQ(1+\theta^{*})}{-c+dQ(1+\theta)} = \frac{(1+\theta^{*})(-b +dX) - MC^{*}(Q,Y)}{(1+\theta)(-b +dX) - MC(Q,Y)}.
\end{align}




Theorem \ref{theorem_lau} shows that when the inverse demand function takes the special form \eqref{eq:demand_separable}, the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function are identified.
However, the problem is that while we can identify the reduced-form function of the equilibrium quantity and the equilibrium price, when the true inverse demand satisfies \eqref{eq:demand_separable}, the inverse demand function cannot be identified.

Under the inverse demand function, the first-order condition is written as
\begin{align}
    \theta s'(Q)Q = MC(Q, X^{s}).
\end{align}
This implies that the equilibrium quantity does not depend on the demand shifter.
Therefore, the equilibrium price also does not depend on the demand shifter.
Therefore, their reduced forms also independent fo the demand shifter.
More formally, Lau's proof shows that when the inverse demand function takes the form, $\frac{\partial h}{\partial X_i^{d}}(Q, X^{d}) = 0$ under the true conduct parameter. 





In this case, while the inverse demand function depends on the demand shifter through $r$, the observed data does not provide any information about $r$ term.
Especially, any $r$ can rationalize the data, which prevent the researcher from identifying the inverse demand function.

Without identifying the inverse demand function, when the researcher pick arbitrary functions of 










\section{Checking sufficiency of separability}

Suppose that the inverse demand function is separable and given by \eqref{eq:demand_separable}.

For the sake of a contradiction, suppose that the conduct parameter is identified.
In this case, for any distinct pairs of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost, at least one equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ violates the condition \eqref{eq:lambda_foc_demand}.
Additionally, $Q^e$ should be realized as an equilibrium quantity for any pair of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost.
Nevertheless, the data does not have the quantity by which the researcher can see the violation of the observable equivalence.

In the following, we consider two cases where the observable equivalence is violated.
The first case is when one side is zero and the other is nonzero at the equilibrium quantity.
The second case is when both sides are nonzero at the equilibrium quantity.

\subsection{Case 1: one side is zero and the other is nonzero at the equilibrium quantity}
Given an inverse demand function, suppose that there is a pair of $\hat{Q}$, $\hat{X}^{d}$, and $\hat{X}^{s}$ such that 
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(\hat{Q}, r(\hat{X}^{d})) + \theta^{*}\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(\hat{Q}, r(\hat{X}^{d}))\hat{Q}  \ne 0,\label{eq:case1_left}\\
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(\hat{Q}, r(\hat{X}^{d})) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(\hat{Q}, r(\hat{X}^{d}))\hat{Q}  = 0.\label{eq:case1_right}
\end{align}
In this case, the observable equivalence is violated because the left-hand side is nonzero but the right-hand side is zero at the equilibrium quantity.


\begin{lemma}
    Given the inverse demand function, if \eqref{eq:case1_right} does not hold for any $Q$, $X^{d}$, there could be a marginal cost function under which $\hat{Q}$ does not arise as an equilibrium quantity.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
    Note that the equation is equivalent to
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial X^{d}_i}\left( P(\hat{Q}, r(X^{d})) + \theta\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}(\hat{Q}, r(X^{d}))\hat{Q}\right) = 0.
    \end{align}
    The inside of the bracket is the marginal revenue function evaluated at the equilibrium quantity, and hence the equation implies that the marginal revenue does not depend on the demand shifter $X^{d}_i$.
    Thus, we can define the marginal revenue function $S(Q)$ depending only on quantity.
    As the inverse demand function is given, $S$ is also known.
    In this case, $\hat{Q}$ solves the first-order condition for the marginal cost function $MC(Q, X^{s})$.
    \begin{align}
        s(\hat{Q}) =  MC(\hat{Q}, X^{s}). \label{eq:case1_mc_foc}
    \end{align}
    Note that given $\hat{Q}$, the left-hand side is a constant and the right-hand side is a function of $X^{s}$.
    Because we assume that the marginal cost is twice continuously differentiable, the intermediate value theorem implies that given $\hat{Q}$, there exists a $\hat{X}^{s}$ that solve \eqref{eq:case1_mc_foc} when the range of the marginal cost includes $S(\hat{Q})$.    
    However, this does not hold for any marginal cost function.
    For example, when the inverse demand function is $P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}r(X^{d})$.
    Then, \eqref{eq:case1_mc_foc} becomes
    \begin{align}
        0 = MC(\hat{Q}, X^{s}).
    \end{align}
    When the range of the marginal cost function does not include zero, we cannot solve the equation for any $X^{s}$ given $\hat{Q}$.
\end{proof}



Now, consider the case where \eqref{eq:case1_right} holds for any $Q$, $X^{d}$.
In this case, the equation is regarded as a partial differential equation of $P(Q, r(X^{d}))$.
When the inverse demand function does not include any term relating to $X^{d}$, \eqref{eq:case1_right} is automatically satisfied for any $Q$, $X^{d}$.
However, in this case, \eqref{eq:case1_left} cannot be nonzero for any $Q$, $X^{d}$, which is a contradiction.
Thus, the inverse demand function should include a term relating to $X^{d}$.
Assume that the inverse demand function has a separable form such that $P(Q, r(X^{d})) = g(Q)r(X^{d}) + s(Q)$.

By substituting the separable function into the differential equation, we have 
\begin{align}
   0 & =  g(Q) r_i(X^{d}) + \theta g'(Q)r_i(X^{d}) Q\\
   & = r_i(X^{d})( g(Q) + \theta g'(Q)Q).
\end{align}
where $r_i(X^{d})$ is the derivative of $r(X^{d})$ with respect to $X^{d}_i$.
When $r_i(X^{d}) = 0$, $r(X^{d})$ should be a constant function, which implies that the inverse demand does not depend on the demand shifter $X^{d}$.
However, we already exclude this case, and hence we assume that $r_i(X^{d}) \ne 0$.
Therefore, we have 
\[g(Q) + \thetag'(Q)Q = 0.\]
This equation is an ordinary differential equation of $Q$ of $g(Q)$.
This can be written as
\begin{align}
    \frac{g'(Q)}{g(Q)} &= -\frac{1}{\theta} \frac{1}{Q}
\end{align}
Because the left-hand side is the derivative of $\log g(Q)$ and the right-hand side is also a derivative of $\log Q$, we have
\begin{align}
        \frac{d}{dQ} \log g(Q) &= -\frac{1}{\theta} \frac{d}{dQ} \log Q.
\end{align}
By integrating this over the domain of $Q$, we have
\begin{align}
    \int_{0}^\infty \frac{d}{dQ} \log g(Q) dQ &= -\frac{1}{\theta} \int_{0}^\infty  \frac{d}{dQ} \log Q dQ \\
    \log g(Q) &= -\frac{1}{\theta} \log Q + C\\
    g(Q) &= C Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}},
\end{align}
where $C$ is the constant of integration.
Substituting this into $f$, we have 
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = C Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}} h(X^{d}) + s(Q).
\end{align}
By redefining $r(X^{d}) = Cr(X^{d})$, we have
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) &= Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta}} r(X^{d}) + s(Q),
\end{align}
which is the same with \eqref{eq:identification_separable}.




On the other hand, when
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(\hat{Q}, \hat{X}^{d}) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(\hat{Q}, \hat{X}^{d})\hat{Q}  =  0,\\
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(\hat{Q}, \hat{X}^{d}) + \theta^{*}\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}\partial Q}(\hat{Q}, \hat{X}^{d})\hat{Q}  \ne 0,
\end{align}
because $\lambda(Q, X^{d}, X^{s}) \ne 0$ for any $Q$, $X^{d}$, and $X^{s}$, the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:lambda_foc_demand} is nonzero.
Therefore, when the true inverse demand function is
\begin{align}
    P(Q, X^{d}) = Q^{-\frac{1}{\theta^{*}}} r(X^{d}) + s(Q),
\end{align}
the observable equivalence is always violated.




\subsection{Case 2: both sides are nonzero at the equilibrium quantity}
In this case, we have that the derivative of the marginal revenue with respect to the demand shifter is nonzero at the equilibrium quantity:
\begin{align}
    r'_i(X^{d})\left[\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}(Q, r(X^{d})) + \theta\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial r\partial Q}(Q, r(X^{d}))Q\right] \ne 0.
\end{align}

This case is not considered in \citet{lau1982identifying}.


\subsubsection{A counterexample}

Note that by assuming $r(X^{d}) = X^{d}$, a separable inverse demand function is equivalent to the case with scalar demand shifter.
Then, consider the following inverse demand function:
\begin{align}
    P(Q, r(X^{d})) = \alpha_0 - \alpha_1 Q + \alpha_2 X^{d} + \alpha_3 QX^{d}.\label{eq:case2_inverse_demand}
\end{align}
Assume that all parameters are non-zero.

Suppose that non-identification holds under the above inverse demand function.
By Lemma \ref{lemma:non-identification_transformation}, there exists two pairs of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function that \eqref{eq:lambda_foc_demand} holds for any $Q^e$, $X^{d}$, and $X^{s}$.
Under the inverse demand function, this becomes
\begin{align}
    \frac{\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 Q (1 + \theta^{*})}{\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 Q (1 + \theta)} = \frac{-\alpha_1 + \alpha_3 X^{d} - \frac{\partial MC^{*}}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s})}{-\alpha_1 + \alpha_3 X^{d} - \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s})}.\label{eq:case2_lambda_foc}
\end{align}
The left-hand side is the ratio of \eqref{eq:case2_inverse_demand} under $\theta$ and $\theta^{*}$, and both denominator and numerator are positive.

To this holds, $MC$ should satisfy
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial MC}{\partial Q}(Q, X^{s}) & = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 (Q(1 + \theta) - X^{d}). 
\end{align}
$MC^{*}$ also satisfies the same condition with $\theta^{*}$ replaced by $\theta$.
However, this implies that the marginal cost function depends on the demand shifter $X^{d}$, which is a contradiction because $X^{d}$ is defined as the variable that does not affect the marginal cost function.
Additionally, any other marginal cost function cannot satisfy \eqref{eq:case2_lambda_foc} for any $Q^e$, $X^{d}$, and $X^{s}$.
Therefore, we cannot have a pair of the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function that satisfies \eqref{eq:case2_lambda_foc} for any $Q^e$, $X^{d}$, and $X^{s}$, which is a contradiction.
This concludes that under the inverse demand function, the conduct parameter is identified.


\section{Necessity of Separability}

From Lemma \ref{lemma:non-identification_transformation}, we know that the non-identification implies the condition \eqref{eq:lambda_foc_demand} holds for all $Q^e$, $X^{d}$, and $X^{s}$.
When the demand shifter is a scalar, from the argument in the previous section, by putting $r(X^{d}) = X^{d}$, we can identify the conduct parameter and the marginal cost function only when the inverse demand function has the form of \eqref{eq:identification_separable}.

When the demand shifter is a vector, \eqref{eq:lambda_foc_demand} implies that
\begin{align}
    (1 - \lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s}))\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_i}(Q^e, X^{d}) = (\lambda(Q^e, X^{d}, X^{s})\theta -  \theta^{*})\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_i\partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})Q^e.
\end{align}
Pick up $i$ and $j$-th elements of the demand shifter and by taking the ratio the above equation, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q^e, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q^e, X^{d})} & = \frac{ \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i} \partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{j} \partial Q}(Q^e, X^{d})},
\end{align}
which is equivalent to \footnote{See \ref{omitted_calculation} for the detailed calculation.}
\begin{align}
    0 & = \left. \left(\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q, X^{d})}\right)^{-1} \frac{\partial}{\partial Q} \left(\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q, X^{d})}\right) \right|_{Q = Q^e}.
    \label{eq:derivative_separable}
\end{align}

Because $X^{d}$ is a vector of demand shifters that affect the inverse demand function, it is natural to think that $\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d}) \ne 0$ for all $i$ and for any $Q$.
Therefore, we should have
\begin{align}
    \frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q, X^{d})} \ne 0 \quad \forall i, j, Q.
\end{align}
Therefore, the first term in \eqref{eq:derivative_separable} is nonzero, which implies that the derivative with respect to $Q$ at $Q^e$ is zero;
\begin{align}
    \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial Q} \left(\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q, X^{d})}\right) \right|_{Q = Q^e} = 0.
\end{align}
This is equivalent to the weak separability in \citet{goldmanNote1964}, and hence we can apply Theorem 2 in \citet{goldmanNote1964} to conclude that when $X^{d}$ is a vector, non-identification implies that the inverse demand function is a separable function such that $P(Q, r(X^{d}))$.


\section{Conclusion and discussion}

We present a counterexample to \citet{lau1982identifying}'s identification result, separability does not imply non-identification.
Our finding is that even though non-identification implies the separability of the inverse demand function, the class of separable inverse demand functions that leads to non-identification is more restricted than the class considered in \citet{lau1982identifying}.

Based on the recent literature on distinguishing firm conduct, this result is not surprising.
For example, in the differentiated product environment, \citet{berry2014identification}  use a broader variation in markets to distinguish conduct beyond demand rotation.
In our counterexample, to violate observable equivalence, we need a variation in $X^{d}$ and $X^{s}$ that leads to a specific equilibrium quantity.
Of course, homogeneous product settings are more restricted than differentiated product settings, but it sounds too strong to claim that any separable demand function is a necessary and sufficient condition for non-identification of the conduct parameter.
Rather, even though the true inverse demand function is separable, the variation in markets may help to identify the conduct parameter.

In this note, we have not investigated the exact class of separable inverse demand functions that leads to non-identification of the conduct parameter.
However, in practice, this does not matter much because to estimate the conduct parameter, the researcher uses a parametric assumption on the inverse demand function and the marginal cost function (e.g., \citet{okazaki2022excess} and \citet{matsumura2024loglinear}).
Even though the researcher wants to non-parametrically estimate the marginal cost function, at least a non-separable demand function leads to the identification of the conduct parameter.

\begin{align}
    \frac{\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{i} \partial Q}(Q, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d})}  & = \frac{\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial X^{d}_{j} \partial Q}(Q, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q, X^{d})}\\ 
    \frac{\partial }{\partial Q} \log\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d})\right) &= \frac{\partial }{\partial Q} \log\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q, X^{d})\right)\\
    0& = \frac{\partial}{\partial Q}\log\left(\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q, X^{d})}\right)
\end{align}
Note that we can exchange the order of partial derivative due to Young's theorem as $P$ is twice continuously differentiable.
Then, by the chain rule, we have
\begin{align}
    0 & = \left(\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q, X^{d})}\right)^{-1} \frac{\partial}{\partial Q} \left(\frac{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{i}}(Q, X^{d})}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial X^{d}_{j}}(Q, X^{d})}\right).
